Title:
Literary Analysis via NLP: Topic Modeling Project Gutenberg

Elevator Pitch: 
I've created a LDA topic model of the internet's largest collection of public domain literature!  Come learn about the data science behind the model, the computational infrastructure set up to support the calculations, and the insights to be gained from this investigation!

Description:
Using a corpus harvested from Project Gutenberg, a large online repository of ebooks, I've developed a topic model of these texts using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).  The topic model allows us to understand a given text almost in terms of an 'ingredients list' - for example, a book could be 40% mystery, 17% romance, 9% thriller, and so on.

Come for the data science, stay for the 'book algebra', where we add and subtract books!  Ever wondered about the sum of Pride & Prejudice and Heart of Darkness?  Or the result of the Illiad minus Alice in Wonderland?  All these burning questions and more can be answered with a doc2vec model!

Finally, I'll introduce you to how you can reproduce this work for yourself with relative ease.  Using Terminal Labs' powerful open-source Project Rambo, after a one-time configuration we can provision any number of development environments identical to the one used in the original development.  From there, you just clone the topic model project repo, and get to work!  All the ETL is done for you, so you can move straight to the fun: exploring and modeling your data.  (Unless you're into ETL - you can reproduce that too.)  Come check out the talk, and then take the code home to play with!

Notes:
This talk would be a continuation of my Galvanize Data Science Immersive Capstone project, which I have had the opportunity to focus on full-time.  The talk will be well-tested by the PyTexas conference, since I will present it for the first time at the Galvanize Capstone showcase on Oct 5th, and I plan to take it to meetups and other interested groups in the interim.  I also will continue expanding and evolving the project between now and PyTexas.  

This is a topic of great personal interest, and I would be so excited and so grateful for the opportunity to share it with the Python community at PyTexas!  The project touches on many different areas (data harvesting, data processing/ETL, distributed/remote computing with AWS, provisioning of virtual machines, data science reproducibility, data streaming as a solution for memory management challenges, unsupervised machine learning, etc etc), so I think that it would appeal to a broad section of the conference audience.  Finally, it is also a project that was developed to really engage the audience, with interactive visualizations and of course the opportunity for people to reproduce and expand upon the work as their own personal side project.

I put down 20 minutes, but if you need a bigger time slot, I could expand it to 50 minutes and do a live demo and/or code-along.

Bio:
I'm an engineer-turned-data-scientist - a trained problem solver and a creative analytical thinker.  Following seven years working at a mix of large multi-national corporations and scrappy Austin startups, I decided to make it official with data science and went through Galvanize's Data Science Immersive program.  I love understanding things and then making them work, and I also love a good book.  When I'm not writing code or doing data science, you can usually find me knitting something.

__Should I put Terminal Labs in the 'Organization or Affliation'?__

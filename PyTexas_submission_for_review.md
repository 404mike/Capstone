Title:
Literary Analysis via NLP: Topic Modeling Project Gutenberg

Elevator Pitch: 
I've created a LDA topic model of the internet's largest collection of public domain literature!  Come learn about the data science behind the model, the computational infrastructure set up to support the calculations, and the insights to be gained from this investigation!

Description:
Using a corpus harvested from Project Gutenberg, a large online repository of ebooks, this project developed a topic model of these texts using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).

Through the use of this and other NLP techniques, I have gained an understanding of the underlying topics that are shared amongst the collection of books, and used this information to analyze the relationships between them.

A large focus of this project is the durability and reproducibility of the data science work.  Through a collaboration with Austin-based software consulting firm Terminal Labs and their open-source Project Rambo, a virtual environment identical to that used in the original development can be automatically provisioned in a single script.  Come check out the talk, and then take the code home to play with!

Notes:
This talk would be a continuation of my Galvanize Data Science Immersive Capstone project, which I have had the opportunity to focus on full-time.  The talk will be well-tested by the PyTexas conference, since I will present it for the first time at the Galvanize Capstone showcase on Oct 5th, and I plan to take it to meetups and other interested groups in the interim.  I also will continue expanding and evolving the project between now and PyTexas.  

This is a topic of great personal interest, and I would be so excited and so grateful for the opportunity to share it with the Python community at PyTexas!  The project touches on many different areas (data harvesting, data processing/ETL, distributed/remote computing with AWS, provisioning of virtual machines, data science reproducibility, data streaming as a solution for memory management challenges, unsupervised machine learning, etc etc), so I think that it would appeal to a broad section of the conference audience.  Finally, it is also a project that was developed to really engage the audience, with interactive visualizations and of course the opportunity for people to reproduce and expand upon the work as their own personal side project.

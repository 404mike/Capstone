call -PRON- ishmael some year ago never mind how long precisely have
little or no money in -PRON- purse and nothing particular to interest -PRON- on
shore -PRON- think -PRON- would sail about a little and see the watery part of
the world -PRON- be a way -PRON- have of driving off the spleen and regulate
the circulation whenever -PRON- find -PRON- grow grim about the mouth
whenever -PRON- be a damp drizzly november in -PRON- soul whenever -PRON- find
-PRON- involuntarily pause before coffin warehouse and bring up
the rear of every funeral -PRON- meet and especially whenever -PRON- hypo get
such an upper hand of -PRON- that -PRON- require a strong moral principle to
prevent -PRON- from deliberately step into the street and methodically
knock people 's hat off then -PRON- account -PRON- high time to get to sea
as soon as -PRON- can this be -PRON- substitute for pistol and ball with a
philosophical flourish cato throw -PRON- upon -PRON- sword -PRON- quietly
take to the ship there be nothing surprising in this if -PRON- but know
-PRON- almost all man in -PRON- degree some time or other cherish very
nearly the same feeling towards the ocean with -PRON-

there now be -PRON- insular city of the manhattoes belt round by
wharf as indian isle by coral reef commerce surround -PRON- with
-PRON- surf right and leave the street take -PRON- waterward -PRON- extreme
downtown be the battery where that noble mole be wash by wave and
cool by breeze which a few hour previous be out of sight of land
look at the crowd of water gazer there

circumambulate the city of a dreamy sabbath afternoon go from corlears
hook to coenties slip and from thence by whitehall northward what
do -PRON- see post like silent sentinel all around the town stand
thousand upon thousand of mortal man fix in ocean reverie some
lean against the spile some seat upon the pier head some
look over the bulwark of ship from china some high aloft in the
rig as if strive to get a still good seaward peep but these
be all landsman of week day pen up in lath and plaster tie to
counter nail to bench clinch to desk how then be this be
the green field go what do -PRON- here

but look here come more crowd pace straight for the water and
seemingly bind for a dive strange nothing will content -PRON- but the
extreme limit of the land loiter under the shady lee of yonder
warehouse will not suffice no -PRON- must get just as nigh the water
as -PRON- possibly can without fall in and there -PRON- stand mile of
-PRON- league inlander all -PRON- come from lane and alley street
and avenue north east south and west yet here -PRON- all unite
tell -PRON- do the magnetic virtue of the needle of the compass of all
those ship attract -PRON- thither

once more say -PRON- be in the country in some high land of lake take
almost any path -PRON- please and ten to one -PRON- carry -PRON- down in a
dale and leave -PRON- there by a pool in the stream there be magic
in -PRON- let the most absent minded of man be plunge in -PRON- deep
reverie stand that man on -PRON- leg set -PRON- foot a go and -PRON- will
infallibly lead -PRON- to water if water there be in all that region
should -PRON- ever be athirst in the great american desert try this
experiment if -PRON- caravan happen to be supply with a metaphysical
professor yes as every one know meditation and water be wed for
ever

but here be an artist -PRON- desire to paint -PRON- the dreamy shadiest
quiet most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of
the saco what be the chief element -PRON- employ there stand -PRON- tree
each with a hollow trunk as if a hermit and a crucifix be within and
here sleep -PRON- meadow and there sleep -PRON- cattle and up from yonder
cottage go a sleepy smoke deep into distant woodland wind a
mazy way reach to overlapping spur of mountain bath in -PRON-
hill side blue but though the picture lie thus trance and though
this pine tree shake down -PRON- sigh like leaf upon this shepherd 's
head yet all be vain unless the shepherd 's eye be fix upon the
magic stream before -PRON- go visit the prairies in june when for score
on score of mile -PRON- wade knee deep among tiger lily what be the
one charm want water there be not a drop of water there be
niagara but a cataract of sand would -PRON- travel -PRON- thousand mile to
see -PRON- why do the poor poet of tennessee upon suddenly receive two
handful of silver deliberate whether to buy -PRON- a coat which -PRON- sadly
need or invest -PRON- money in a pedestrian trip to rockaway beach why
be almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in -PRON- at
some time or other crazy to go to sea why upon -PRON- first voyage as a
passenger do -PRON- -PRON- feel such a mystical vibration when first
tell that -PRON- and -PRON- ship be now out of sight of land why do the
old persians hold the sea holy why do the greeks give -PRON- a separate
deity and own brother of jove surely all this be not without meaning
and still deeper the meaning of that story of narcissus who because
-PRON- could not grasp the tormenting mild image -PRON- see in the fountain
plunge into -PRON- and be drown but that same image -PRON- -PRON- see
in all river and ocean -PRON- be the image of the ungraspable phantom of
life and this be the key to -PRON- all

now when -PRON- say that -PRON- be in the habit of go to sea whenever -PRON- begin
to grow hazy about the eye and begin to be over conscious of -PRON- lung
-PRON- do not mean to have -PRON- infer that -PRON- ever go to sea as a passenger
for to go as a passenger -PRON- must need have a purse and a purse be
but a rag unless -PRON- have something in -PRON- besides passenger get
sea sick grow quarrelsome don't sleep of night do not enjoy
-PRON- much as a general thing no -PRON- never go as a passenger
nor though -PRON- be something of a salt do -PRON- ever go to sea as a
commodore or a captain or a cook -PRON- abandon the glory and distinction
of such office to those who like -PRON- for -PRON- part -PRON- abominate all
honourable respectable toil trial and tribulation of every kind
whatsoever -PRON- be quite as much as -PRON- can do to take care of -PRON-
without take care of ship barque brig schooner and what not
and as for go as cook though -PRON- confes there be considerable glory
in that a cook be a sort of officer on ship board yet somehow
-PRON- never fancy broil fowl though once broil judiciously
butter and judgmatically salt and pepper there be no one who
will speak more respectfully not to say reverentially of a broiled
fowl than -PRON- will -PRON- be out of the idolatrous doting of the old
egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse that -PRON- see the
mummy of those creature in -PRON- huge bake house the pyramids

no when -PRON- go to sea -PRON- go as a simple sailor right before the mast
plumb down into the forecastle aloft there to the royal mast head
true -PRON- rather order -PRON- about some and make -PRON- jump from spar to
spar like a grasshopper in a may meadow and at first this sort
of thing be unpleasant enough -PRON- touch one 's sense of honour
particularly if -PRON- come of an old establish family in the land the
van rensselaers or randolphs or hardicanutes and more than all
if just previous to put -PRON- hand into the tar pot -PRON- have be
lord -PRON- as a country schoolmaster make the tall boy stand
in awe of -PRON- the transition be a keen one -PRON- assure -PRON- from a
schoolmaster to a sailor and require a strong decoction of seneca and
the stoics to enable -PRON- to grin and bear -PRON- but even this wear off in
time

what of -PRON- if some old hunk of a sea captain order -PRON- to get a broom
and sweep down the deck what do that indignity amount to weigh
-PRON- mean in the scale of the new testament do -PRON- think the archangel
gabriel think anything the less of -PRON- because -PRON- promptly and
respectfully obey that old hunk in that particular instance who be not
a slave tell -PRON- that well then however the old sea captain may
order -PRON- about however -PRON- may thump and punch -PRON- about -PRON- have the
satisfaction of know that -PRON- be all right that everybody else be
one way or other serve in much the same way either in a physical
or metaphysical point of view that be and so the universal thump be
pass round and all hand should rub each other 's shoulder blade and
be content

again -PRON- always go to sea as a sailor because -PRON- make a point of
pay -PRON- for -PRON- trouble whereas -PRON- never pay passenger a single
penny that -PRON- ever hear of on the contrary passenger -PRON- must
pay and there be all the difference in the world between pay
and be pay the act of pay be perhaps the most uncomfortable
infliction that the two orchard thief entail upon -PRON- but being
paid what will compare with -PRON- the urbane activity with which a man
receive money be really marvellous consider that -PRON- so earnestly
believe money to be the root of all earthly ill and that on no account
can a monied man enter heaven ah how cheerfully -PRON- consign -PRON-
to perdition

finally -PRON- always go to sea as a sailor because of the wholesome
exercise and pure air of the fore castle deck for as in this world
head wind be far more prevalent than wind from astern that be
if -PRON- never violate the pythagorean maxim so for the most part the
commodore on the quarter deck get -PRON- atmosphere at second hand from
the sailor on the forecastle -PRON- think -PRON- breathe -PRON- first but not
so in much the same way do the commonalty lead -PRON- leader in many
other thing at the same time that the leader little suspect -PRON-
but wherefore -PRON- be that after have repeatedly smell the sea as a
merchant sailor -PRON- should now take -PRON- into -PRON- head to go on a whaling
voyage this the invisible police officer of the fates who have the
constant surveillance of -PRON- and secretly dog -PRON- and influence -PRON-
in some unaccountable way -PRON- can better answer than any one else and
doubtless -PRON- go on this whaling voyage form part of the grand
programme of providence that be draw up a long time ago -PRON- come in as
a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive performance
-PRON- take -PRON- that this part of the bill must have run something like this


grand contested election for the presidency of the united states

whaling voyage by one ishmael

bloody battle in affghanistan


though -PRON- can not tell why -PRON- be exactly that those stage manager the
fate put -PRON- down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage when other
be set down for magnificent part in high tragedy and short and
easy part in genteel comedy and jolly part in farce though
-PRON- can not tell why this be exactly yet now that -PRON- recall all the
circumstance -PRON- think -PRON- can see a little into the spring and motif
which be cunningly present to -PRON- under various disguise induce
-PRON- to set about perform the part -PRON- do besides cajole -PRON- into the
delusion that -PRON- be a choice result from -PRON- own unbiased freewill
and discriminate judgment

chief among these motif be the overwhelming idea of the great
whale -PRON- such a portentous and mysterious monster rouse all -PRON-
curiosity then the wild and distant sea where -PRON- roll -PRON- island
bulk the undeliverable nameless peril of the whale these with all
the attend marvel of a thousand patagonian sight and sound help
to sway -PRON- to -PRON- wish with other man perhaps such thing would not
have be inducement but as for -PRON- -PRON- be torment with an everlasting
itch for thing remote -PRON- love to sail forbid seas and land on
barbarous coast not ignore what be good -PRON- be quick to perceive a
horror and could still be social with -PRON- would -PRON- let -PRON- since -PRON-
be but well to be on friendly term with all the inmate of the place
one lodge in

by reason of these thing then the whaling voyage be welcome the
great flood gate of the wonder world swing open and in the wild
conceit that sway -PRON- to -PRON- purpose two and two there float into
-PRON- inmost soul endless procession of the whale and mid most of -PRON-
all one grand hooded phantom like a snow hill in the air



chapter 2 the carpet bag


-PRON- stuff a shirt or two into -PRON- old carpet bag tuck -PRON- under -PRON- arm
and start for cape horn and the pacific quit the good city of
old manhatto -PRON- duly arrive in new bedford -PRON- be a saturday night in
december much be -PRON- disappoint upon learn that the little packet
for nantucket have already sail and that no way of reach that place
would offer till the follow monday

as most young candidate for the pain and penalty of whale stop at
this same new bedford thence to embark on -PRON- voyage -PRON- may as well
be relate that -PRON- for one have no idea of so do for -PRON- mind be
make up to sail in no other than a nantucket craft because there be a
fine boisterous something about everything connect with that famous
old island which amazingly please -PRON- besides though new bedford have
of late be gradually monopolise the business of whaling and though
in this matter poor old nantucket be now much behind -PRON- yet nantucket
be -PRON- great original the tyre of this carthage the place where the
first dead american whale be strand where else but from nantucket
do those aboriginal whaleman the red men first sally out in canoe to
give chase to the leviathan and where but from nantucket too do that
first adventurous little sloop put forth partly laden with import
cobblestone so go the story to throw at the whale in order to
discover when -PRON- be nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit

now have a night a day and still another night follow before -PRON-
in new bedford ere -PRON- could embark for -PRON- destine port -PRON- become a
matter of concernment where -PRON- be to eat and sleep meanwhile -PRON- be a
very dubious look nay a very dark and dismal night bitingly cold
and cheerless -PRON- know no one in the place with anxious grapnel -PRON- have
sound -PRON- pocket and only bring up a few piece of silver so
wherever -PRON- go ishmael say -PRON- to -PRON- as -PRON- stand in the middle of
a dreary street shoulder -PRON- bag and compare the gloom towards the
north with the darkness towards the south wherever in -PRON- wisdom -PRON-
may conclude to lodge for the night -PRON- dear ishmael be sure to inquire
the price and do not be too particular

with halt step -PRON- pace the street and pass the sign of the
cross harpoons but -PRON- look too expensive and jolly there further
on from the bright red window of the sword fish inn there come such
fervent ray that -PRON- seem to have melt the packed snow and ice from
before the house for everywhere else the congealed frost lie ten inch
thick in a hard asphaltic pavement rather weary for -PRON- when -PRON- strike
-PRON- foot against the flinty projection because from hard remorseless
service the sol of -PRON- boot be in a most miserable plight too
expensive and jolly again think -PRON- pause one moment to watch the
broad glare in the street and hear the sound of the tinkling glass
within but go on ishmael say -PRON- at last do not -PRON- hear get away
from before the door -PRON- patched boot be stop the way so on -PRON-
go -PRON- now by instinct follow the street that take -PRON- waterward for
there doubtless be the cheap if not the cheery inn

such dreary street block of blackness not house on either hand
and here and there a candle like a candle move about in a tomb at
this hour of the night of the last day of the week that quarter of
the town prove all but desert but presently -PRON- come to a smoky light
proceed from a low wide building the door of which stand invitingly
open -PRON- have a careless look as if -PRON- be mean for the us of the
public so enter the first thing -PRON- do be to stumble over an
ash box in the porch ha think -PRON- ha as the fly particle almost
choke -PRON- be these ash from that destroy city gomorrah but the
crossed harpoon and the sword fish this then must need be the
sign of the trap however -PRON- pick -PRON- up and hear a loud voice
within push on and open a second interior door

-PRON- seem the great black parliament sit in tophet a hundred black
face turn round in -PRON- row to peer and beyond a black angel
of doom be beat a book in a pulpit -PRON- be a negro church and the
preacher 's text be about the blackness of darkness and the weeping and
wailing and teeth gnash there ha ishmael mutter -PRON- back out
wretched entertainment at the sign of the trap

move on -PRON- at last come to a dim sort of light not far from the dock
and hear a forlorn creaking in the air and look up see a swing
sign over the door with a white painting upon -PRON- faintly represent
a tall straight jet of misty spray and these word underneath--"the
spouter inn peter coffin

coffin spouter rather ominous in that particular connexion think
i. but -PRON- be a common name in nantucket -PRON- say and -PRON- suppose this
peter here be an emigrant from there as the light look so dim and
the place for the time look quiet enough and the dilapidated little
wooden house -PRON- look as if -PRON- may have be cart here from
the ruin of some burn district and as the swinging sign have a
poverty stricken sort of creak to -PRON- -PRON- think that here be the very
spot for cheap lodging and the good of pea coffee

-PRON- be a queer sort of place a gable ended old house one side palsy
as -PRON- be and lean over sadly -PRON- stand on a sharp bleak corner
where that tempestuous wind euroclydon keep up a bad howling than ever
-PRON- do about poor paul 's toss craft euroclydon nevertheless be a
mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in door with -PRON- foot on the hob
quietly toast for bed in judging of that tempestuous wind call
euroclydon say an old writer of whose work -PRON- posses the only copy
extant--"it maketh a marvellous difference whether thou lookest out at
-PRON- from a glass window where the frost be all on the outside or whether
thou observest -PRON- from that sashless window where the frost be on both
side and of which the wight death be the only glazier true enough
think -PRON- as this passage occur to -PRON- mind old black letter thou
reasonest well yes these eye be window and this body of -PRON- be
the house what a pity -PRON- do not stop up the chink and the cranny
though and thrust in a little lint here and there but -PRON- be too late
to make any improvement now the universe be finish the copestone
be on and the chip be cart off a million year ago poor lazarus
there chatter -PRON- tooth against the curbstone for -PRON- pillow and
shake off -PRON- tatter with -PRON- shivering -PRON- may plug up both ear
with rag and put a corn cob into -PRON- mouth and yet that would not
keep out the tempestuous euroclydon euroclydon say old dive in -PRON-
red silken wrapper--(he have a redder one afterwards pooh pooh what
a fine frosty night how orion glitter what northern light let -PRON-
talk of -PRON- oriental summer clime of everlasting conservatory give
-PRON- the privilege of make -PRON- own summer with -PRON- own coal

but what think lazarus can -PRON- warm -PRON- blue hand by hold -PRON- up
to the grand northern light would not lazarus rather be in sumatra
than here would -PRON- not far rather lie -PRON- down lengthwise along the
line of the equator yea ye god go down to the fiery pit -PRON- in
order to keep out this frost

now that lazarus should lie strand there on the curbstone before the
door of dive this be more wonderful than that an iceberg should be
moor to one of the moluccas yet dive -PRON- -PRON- too live like a
czar in an ice palace make of frozen sigh and be a president of a
temperance society -PRON- only drink the tepid tear of orphan

but no more of this blubbering now -PRON- be go a whaling and there be
plenty of that yet to come let -PRON- scrape the ice from -PRON- frosted foot
and see what sort of a place this spouter may be



chapter 3 the spouter inn


enter that gable ended spouter inn -PRON- find -PRON- in a wide
low straggle entry with old fashioned wainscot remind one of
the bulwark of some condemn old craft on one side hang a very large
oilpaint so thoroughly besmok and every way deface that in the
unequal crosslight by which -PRON- view -PRON- -PRON- be only by diligent
study and a series of systematic visit to -PRON- and careful inquiry of
the neighbor that -PRON- could any way arrive at an understanding of -PRON-
purpose such unaccountable mass of shade and shadow that at first
-PRON- almost think some ambitious young artist in the time of the new
england hags have endeavor to delineate chaos bewitch but by dint
of much and earnest contemplation and oft repeat pondering and
especially by throw open the little window towards the back of the
entry -PRON- at last come to the conclusion that such an idea however
wild may not be altogether unwarranted

but what most puzzled and confound -PRON- be a long limber portentous
black mass of something hover in the centre of the picture over three
blue dim perpendicular line float in a nameless yeast a boggy
soggy squitchy picture truly enough to drive a nervous man distract
yet be there a sort of indefinite half attain unimaginable
sublimity about -PRON- that fairly freeze -PRON- to -PRON- till -PRON- involuntarily
take an oath with -PRON- to find out what that marvellous painting
meant ever and anon a bright but alas deceptive idea would dart -PRON-
through -PRON- be the black sea in a midnight gale -PRON- be the unnatural
combat of the four primal element -PRON- be a blast heath -PRON- be a
hyperborean winter scene -PRON- be the breaking up of the icebound stream
of time but at last all these fancy yield to that one portentous
something in the picture 's midst that once find out and all the rest
be plain but stop do -PRON- not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic
fish even the great leviathan -PRON-

in fact the artist 's design seem this a final theory of -PRON- own
partly base upon the aggregated opinion of many aged person with whom
-PRON- converse upon the subject the picture represent a cape horner in a
great hurricane the half founder ship welter there with -PRON- three
dismantle mast alone visible and an exasperated whale purpose to
spring clean over the craft be in the enormous act of impale -PRON-
upon the three mast head

the opposite wall of this entry be hang all over with a heathenish
array of monstrous club and spear some be thickly set with
glitter tooth resemble ivory saw other be tuft with knot of
human hair and one be sickle shape with a vast handle sweeping round
like the segment make in the new mow grass by a long armed mower -PRON-
shudder as -PRON- gaze and wonder what monstrous cannibal and savage
could ever have go a death harvest with such a hacking horrify
implement mix with these be rusty old whaling lance and harpoon
all broken and deformed some be storied weapon with this once long
lance now wildly elbow fifty year ago do nathan swain kill fifteen
whale between a sunrise and a sunset and that harpoon so like a
corkscrew now be flung in javan sea and run away with by a whale
year afterwards slay off the cape of blanco the original iron enter
nigh the tail and like a restless needle sojourning in the body of a
man travel full forty foot and at last be find imbed in the
hump

crossing this dusky entry and on through yon low arched way cut
through what in old time must have be a great central chimney with
fireplace all round -PRON- enter the public room a still dusky place
be this with such low ponderous beam above and such old wrinkled
plank beneath that -PRON- would almost fancy -PRON- tread some old craft 's
cockpit especially of such a howling night when this corner anchor
old ark rock so furiously on one side stand a long low shelf like
table cover with crack glass case fill with dusty rarity
gather from this wide world 's remotest nook project from the
further angle of the room stand a dark look den the bar a rude
attempt at a right whale 's head be that how -PRON- may there stand the
vast arched bone of the whale 's jaw so wide a coach may almost drive
beneath -PRON- within be shabby shelf range round with old decanter
bottle flask and in those jaw of swift destruction like another
curse jonah by which name indeed -PRON- call -PRON- bustle a little
wither old man who for -PRON- money dearly sell the sailor
delirium and death

abominable be the tumbler into which -PRON- pour -PRON- poison though
true cylinder without within the villanous green goggle glass
deceitfully taper downward to a cheating bottom parallel meridian
rudely peck into the glass surround these footpad goblet fill to
this mark and -PRON- charge be but a penny to this a penny more and so
on to the full glass the cape horn measure which -PRON- may gulp down for
a shilling

upon enter the place -PRON- find a number of young seaman gather about
a table examine by a dim light diver specimen of skrimshander -PRON-
seek the landlord and tell -PRON- -PRON- desire to be accommodate with a
room receive for answer that -PRON- house be full not a bed unoccupied
but avast -PRON- add tap -PRON- forehead -PRON- haint no objection
to share a harpooneer 's blanket have ye -PRON- s'pose -PRON- be goin'
a whalin so -PRON- would better get use to that sort of thing

-PRON- tell -PRON- that -PRON- never like to sleep two in a bed that if -PRON- should
ever do so -PRON- would depend upon who the harpooneer may be and
that if -PRON- the landlord really have no other place for -PRON- and the
harpooneer be not decidedly objectionable why rather than wander
further about a strange town on so bitter a night -PRON- would put up with
the half of any decent man 's blanket

-PRON- think so all right take a seat supper -PRON- want supper
supper'll be ready directly

-PRON- sit down on an old wooden settle carve all over like a bench on the
battery at one end a ruminate tar be still further adorn -PRON- with
-PRON- jack knife stoop over and diligently work away at the space
between -PRON- leg -PRON- be try -PRON- hand at a ship under full sail but
-PRON- do not make much headway -PRON- think

at last some four or five of -PRON- be summon to -PRON- meal in an
adjoining room -PRON- be cold as iceland no fire at all the landlord
say -PRON- could not afford -PRON- nothing but two dismal tallow candle each
in a wind sheet -PRON- be fain to button up -PRON- monkey jacket and
hold to -PRON- lip cup of scald tea with -PRON- half frozen finger but
the fare be of the most substantial kind not only meat and potato
but dumpling good heaven dumpling for supper one young fellow in
a green box coat address -PRON- to these dumpling in a most direful
manner

-PRON- boy say the landlord -PRON- 'll have the nightmare to a dead
sartainty

landlord -PRON- whisper that be not the harpooneer be -PRON-

oh no say -PRON- look a sort of diabolically funny the harpooneer
be a dark complexion chap -PRON- never eat dumpling -PRON- don't -PRON- eat
nothing but steak and -PRON- like 'em rare

the devil -PRON- do say i. where be that harpooneer be -PRON- here

-PRON- 'll be here afore long be the answer

-PRON- could not help -PRON- but -PRON- begin to feel suspicious of this dark
complexion harpooneer at any rate -PRON- make up -PRON- mind that if -PRON- so
turn out that -PRON- should sleep together -PRON- must undress and get into
bed before -PRON- do

supper over the company go back to the bar room when know not
what else to do with -PRON- -PRON- resolve to spend the rest of the evening
as a looker on

presently a rioting noise be hear without start up the landlord
cry that be the grampus 's crew -PRON- see -PRON- report in the offing
this morning a three year voyage and a full ship hurrah boy now
-PRON- will have the late news from the feegees

a tramping of sea boot be hear in the entry the door be fling open
and in roll a wild set of mariner enough envelop in -PRON- shaggy
watch coat and with -PRON- head muffle in woollen comforter all
bedarn and rag and -PRON- beard stiff with icicle -PRON- seem an
eruption of bear from labrador -PRON- have just land from -PRON- boat
and this be the first house -PRON- enter no wonder then that -PRON-
make a straight wake for the whale 's mouth the bar when the wrinkled
little old jonah there officiating soon pour -PRON- out brimmer all
round one complain of a bad cold in -PRON- head upon which jonah
mix -PRON- a pitch like potion of gin and molass which -PRON- swear be a
sovereign cure for all cold and catarrhs whatsoever never mind of how
long standing or whether catch off the coast of labrador or on the
weather side of an ice island

the liquor soon mount into -PRON- head as -PRON- generally do even
with the arrant toper newly land from sea and -PRON- begin caper
about most obstreperously

-PRON- observe however that one of -PRON- hold somewhat aloof and though
-PRON- seem desirous not to spoil the hilarity of -PRON- shipmate by -PRON- own
sober face yet upon the whole -PRON- refrain from make as much noise
as the rest this man interest -PRON- at once and since the sea god
have ordain that -PRON- should soon become -PRON- shipmate though but a
sleep partner one so far as this narrative be concern -PRON- will
here venture upon a little description of -PRON- -PRON- stand full six foot
in height with noble shoulder and a chest like a coffer dam -PRON- have
seldom see such brawn in a man -PRON- face be deeply brown and burn
make -PRON- white tooth dazzle by the contrast while in the deep
shadow of -PRON- eye float some reminiscence that do not seem to give
-PRON- much joy -PRON- voice at once announce that -PRON- be a southerner
and from -PRON- fine stature -PRON- think -PRON- must be one of those tall
mountaineer from the alleghanian ridge in virginia when the revelry
of -PRON- companion have mount to -PRON- height this man slip away
unobserved and -PRON- see no more of -PRON- till -PRON- become -PRON- comrade on the
sea in a few minute however -PRON- be miss by -PRON- shipmate and
be -PRON- seem for some reason a huge favourite with -PRON- -PRON- raise
a cry of bulkington bulkington where be bulkington and dart out of
the house in pursuit of -PRON-

-PRON- be now about nine o'clock and the room seem almost
supernaturally quiet after these orgy -PRON- begin to congratulate -PRON-
upon a little plan that have occur to -PRON- just previous to the entrance
of the seamen

no man prefer to sleep two in a bed in fact -PRON- would a good deal
rather not sleep with -PRON- own brother -PRON- do not know how -PRON- be but
people like to be private when -PRON- be sleep and when -PRON- come to
sleep with an unknown stranger in a strange inn in a strange
town and that stranger a harpooneer then -PRON- objection indefinitely
multiply nor be there any earthly reason why -PRON- as a sailor should
sleep two in a bed more than anybody else for sailor no more sleep
two in a bed at sea than bachelor king do ashore to be sure -PRON-
all sleep together in one apartment but -PRON- have -PRON- own hammock and
cover -PRON- with -PRON- own blanket and sleep in -PRON- own skin

the more -PRON- ponder over this harpooneer the more -PRON- abominate the
thought of sleep with -PRON- -PRON- be fair to presume that be a
harpooneer -PRON- linen or woollen as the case may be would not be of
the tidy certainly none of the fine -PRON- begin to twitch all over
besides -PRON- be get late and -PRON- decent harpooneer ought to be
home and go bedward suppose now -PRON- should tumble in upon -PRON- at
midnight how could -PRON- tell from what vile hole -PRON- have be come

landlord -PRON- have change -PRON- mind about that harpooneer -PRON- shall not sleep
with -PRON- -PRON- will try the bench here

just as -PRON- please -PRON- be sorry -PRON- can not spare ye a tablecloth for a
mattress and -PRON- be a plaguy rough board here feeling of the knot and
notch but wait a bit skrimshander -PRON- have get a carpenter 's plane
there in the bar wait -PRON- say and -PRON- will make ye snug enough so say
-PRON- procure the plane and with -PRON- old silk handkerchief first dust
the bench vigorously set to plan away at -PRON- bed the while grin
like an ape the shaving fly right and left till at last the
plane iron come bump against an indestructible knot the landlord be
near sprain -PRON- wrist and -PRON- tell -PRON- for heaven 's sake to quit the
bed be soft enough to suit -PRON- and -PRON- do not know how all the planing
in the world could make eid down of a pine plank so gather up the
shaving with another grin and throw -PRON- into the great stove in
the middle of the room -PRON- go about -PRON- business and leave -PRON- in a
brown study

-PRON- now take the measure of the bench and find that -PRON- be a foot too
short but that could be mend with a chair but -PRON- be a foot too
narrow and the other bench in the room be about four inch high
than the plan one so there be no yoke -PRON- -PRON- then place the
first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall
leave a little interval between for -PRON- back to settle down in but -PRON-
soon find that there come such a draught of cold air over -PRON- from under
the sill of the window that this plan would never do at all especially
as another current from the rickety door meet the one from the window
and both together form a series of small whirlwind in the immediate
vicinity of the spot where -PRON- have think to spend the night

the devil fetch that harpooneer think -PRON- but stop could not -PRON- steal
a march on -PRON- bolt -PRON- door inside and jump into -PRON- bed not to be
waken by the most violent knocking -PRON- seem no bad idea but upon
second thought -PRON- dismiss -PRON- for who could tell but what the next
morning so soon as -PRON- pop out of the room the harpooneer may be
stand in the entry all ready to knock -PRON- down

still look round -PRON- again and see no possible chance of spending
a sufferable night unless in some other person 's bed -PRON- begin to think
that after all -PRON- may be cherish unwarrantable prejudice against
this unknown harpooneer think -PRON- -PRON- will wait awhile -PRON- must be drop
in before long -PRON- will have a good look at -PRON- then and perhaps -PRON- may
become jolly good bedfellow after all there be no telling

but though the other boarder keep come in by one two and three
and go to bed yet no sign of -PRON- harpooneer

landlord say -PRON- what sort of a chap be -PRON- do -PRON- always keep such
late hour -PRON- be now hard upon twelve o'clock

the landlord chuckle again with -PRON- lean chuckle and seem to
be mightily tickle at something beyond -PRON- comprehension no -PRON-
answer generally -PRON- be an early bird airley to bed and airley to
rise yes -PRON- be the bird what catch the worm but to night -PRON- go out
a peddling -PRON- see and -PRON- do not see what on airth keep -PRON- so late
unless may be -PRON- can not sell -PRON- head

ca n't sell -PRON- head what sort of a bamboozingly story be this -PRON-
be tell -PRON- get into a towering rage do -PRON- pretend to say
landlord that this harpooneer be actually engage this blessed saturday
night or rather sunday morning in peddle -PRON- head around this town

that be precisely -PRON- say the landlord and -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- could not
sell -PRON- here the market 's overstock

with what shout i.

with head to be sure be not there too many head in the world

-PRON- tell -PRON- what -PRON- be landlord say -PRON- quite calmly -PRON- 'd better
stop spin that yarn to -PRON- i'm not green

may be not take out a stick and whittle a toothpick but -PRON-
rayther gues -PRON- will be do brown if that ere harpooneer hear -PRON- a
slanderin -PRON- head

-PRON- 'll break -PRON- for -PRON- say -PRON- now fly into a passion again at this
unaccountable farrago of the landlord 's

-PRON- be broke a'ready say -PRON-

broke say i--"broke do -PRON- mean

sartain and that be the very reason -PRON- can not sell -PRON- -PRON- gues

landlord say -PRON- go up to -PRON- as cool as mt. hecla in a
snow storm--"landlord stop whittle -PRON- and -PRON- must understand one
another and that too without delay -PRON- come to -PRON- house and want a
bed -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- can only give -PRON- half a one that the other half
belong to a certain harpooneer and about this harpooneer whom -PRON-
have not yet see -PRON- persist in tell -PRON- the most mystifying and
exasperating story tend to beget in -PRON- an uncomfortable feeling
towards the man whom -PRON- design for -PRON- bedfellow a sort of connexion
landlord which be an intimate and confidential one in the high
degree -PRON- now demand of -PRON- to speak out and tell -PRON- who and what this
harpooneer be and whether -PRON- shall be in all respect safe to spend the
night with -PRON- and in the first place -PRON- will be so good as to unsay
that story about sell -PRON- head which if true -PRON- take to be good
evidence that this harpooneer be stark mad and -PRON- have no idea of sleep
with a madman and -PRON- sir you -PRON- mean landlord you sir by try
to induce -PRON- to do so knowingly would thereby render -PRON- liable to
a criminal prosecution

wall say the landlord fetch a long breath that be a purty long
sarmon for a chap that rip a little now and then but be easy be easy
this here harpooneer -PRON- have be tellin -PRON- of have just arrive from
the south sea where -PRON- buy up a lot of balm new zealand head

-PRON- be try to sell to night cause to morrow 's sunday and -PRON- would not
do to be sellin human head about the street when folk be goin' to
church -PRON- want to last sunday but -PRON- stop -PRON- just as -PRON- be
goin' out of the door with four head string on a string for all the
airth like a string of inion

this account clear up the otherwise unaccountable mystery and show
that the landlord after all have have no idea of fool -PRON- but at
the same time what could -PRON- think of a harpooneer who stay out of a
saturday night clean into the holy sabbath engage in such a cannibal
business as sell the head of dead idolator

depend upon -PRON- landlord that harpooneer be a dangerous man

-PRON- pay reg'lar be the rejoinder but come -PRON- be get dreadful
late -PRON- have good be turn fluke -PRON- be a nice bed sal and -PRON-
sleep in that ere bed the night -PRON- be splice there be plenty of room
for two to kick about in that bed -PRON- be an almighty big bed that why
afore -PRON- give -PRON- up sal use to put -PRON- sam and little johnny in the
foot of -PRON- but -PRON- get a dreaming and sprawl about one night and
somehow sam get pitch on the floor and come near break -PRON- arm
arter that sal say -PRON- would not do come along here -PRON- will give ye a
glim in a jiffy and so say -PRON- light a candle and hold -PRON- towards
-PRON- offer to lead the way but -PRON- stand irresolute when look at a
clock in the corner -PRON- exclaim -PRON- vum -PRON- be sunday -PRON- will not see that
harpooneer to night -PRON- be come to anchor somewhere come along then do
come won't ye come

-PRON- consider the matter a moment and then up stair -PRON- go and -PRON- be
usher into a small room cold as a clam and furnish sure enough
with a prodigious bed almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneer
to sleep abreast

there say the landlord place the candle on a crazy old sea chest
that do double duty as a wash stand and centre table there make
-PRON- comfortable now and good night to ye -PRON- turn round from
eye the bed but -PRON- have disappear

fold back the counterpane -PRON- stoop over the bed though none of the
most elegant -PRON- yet stand the scrutiny tolerably well -PRON- then glance
round the room and besides the bedstead and centre table could see
no other furniture belong to the place but a rude shelf the four
wall and a paper fireboard represent a man strike a whale of
thing not properly belong to the room there be a hammock lash
up and throw upon the floor in one corner also a large seaman 's bag
contain the harpooneer 's wardrobe no doubt in lieu of a land trunk
likewise there be a parcel of outlandish bone fish hook on the shelf
over the fire place and a tall harpoon stand at the head of the bed

but what be this on the chest -PRON- take -PRON- up and hold -PRON- close to the
light and feel -PRON- and smell -PRON- and try every way possible to arrive
at some satisfactory conclusion concern -PRON- -PRON- can compare -PRON- to
nothing but a large door mat ornament at the edge with little
tinkling tag something like the stain porcupine quill round an
indian moccasin there be a hole or slit in the middle of this mat
as -PRON- see the same in south american ponchos but could -PRON- be possible
that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat and parade the
street of any christian town in that sort of guise -PRON- put -PRON- on to try
-PRON- and -PRON- weigh -PRON- down like a hamper be uncommonly shaggy and
thick and -PRON- think a little damp as though this mysterious harpooneer
have be wear -PRON- of a rainy day -PRON- go up in -PRON- to a bit of glass
stick against the wall and -PRON- never see such a sight in -PRON- life -PRON- tear
-PRON- out of -PRON- in such a hurry that -PRON- give -PRON- a kink in the neck

-PRON- sit down on the side of the bed and commence think about this
head peddle harpooneer and -PRON- door mat after think some time on
the bed side -PRON- get up and take off -PRON- monkey jacket and then stand in
the middle of the room thinking -PRON- then take off -PRON- coat and think
a little more in -PRON- shirt sleeve but begin to feel very cold now
half undressed as -PRON- be and remember what the landlord say about
the harpooneer be not come home at all that night -PRON- be so very
late -PRON- make no more ado but jump out of -PRON- pantaloon and boot and
then blow out the light tumble into bed and commend -PRON- to the
care of heaven

whether that mattress be stuff with corn cobs or break crockery
there be no telling but -PRON- roll about a good deal and could not sleep
for a long time at last -PRON- slide off into a light doze and have pretty
nearly make a good offing towards the land of nod when -PRON- hear a heavy
footfall in the passage and see a glimmer of light come into the room
from under the door

lord save -PRON- think -PRON- that must be the harpooneer the infernal
head peddler but -PRON- lie perfectly still and resolve not to say a word
till speak to hold a light in one hand and that identical new
zealand head in the other the stranger enter the room and without
look towards the bed place -PRON- candle a good way off from -PRON- on the
floor in one corner and then begin work away at the knot cord
of the large bag -PRON- before speak of as be in the room -PRON- be all
eagerness to see -PRON- face but -PRON- keep -PRON- avert for some time while
employ in unlace the bag 's mouth this accomplish however -PRON-
turn round when good heaven what a sight such a face -PRON- be of
a dark purplish yellow colour here and there stick over with large
blackish look square yes -PRON- be just as -PRON- think -PRON- be a terrible
bedfellow -PRON- be be in a fight get dreadfully cut and here -PRON- be
just from the surgeon but at that moment -PRON- chance to turn -PRON- face
so towards the light that -PRON- plainly see -PRON- could not be
stick plaster at all those black square on -PRON- cheek -PRON- be
stain of some sort or other at first -PRON- know not what to make of this
but soon an inkling of the truth occur to -PRON- -PRON- remember a story of
a white man a whaleman too who fall among the cannibal have be
tattooed by -PRON- -PRON- conclude that this harpooneer in the course of -PRON-
distant voyage must have meet with a similar adventure and what be -PRON-
think -PRON- after all -PRON- be only -PRON- outside a man can be honest in any
sort of skin but then what to make of -PRON- unearthly complexion that
part of -PRON- -PRON- mean lie round about and completely independent of the
square of tattooing to be sure -PRON- may be nothing but a good coat of
tropical tanning but -PRON- never hear of a hot sun be tan a white man
into a purplish yellow one however -PRON- have never be in the south seas
and perhaps the sun there produce these extraordinary effect upon the
skin now while all these idea be pass through -PRON- like lightning
this harpooneer never notice -PRON- at all but after some difficulty
have open -PRON- bag -PRON- commence fumble in -PRON- and presently pull
out a sort of tomahawk and a seal skin wallet with the hair on place
these on the old chest in the middle of the room -PRON- then take the new
zealand head a ghastly thing enough and cram -PRON- down into the bag
-PRON- now take off -PRON- hat a new beaver hat when -PRON- come nigh sing out
with fresh surprise there be no hair on -PRON- head none to speak of at
least nothing but a small scalp knot twist up on -PRON- forehead -PRON-
bald purplish head now look for all the world like a mildew skull
have not the stranger stand between -PRON- and the door -PRON- would have bolt
out of -PRON- quicker than ever -PRON- bolt a dinner

even as -PRON- be -PRON- think something of slip out of the window but
-PRON- be the second floor back -PRON- be no coward but what to make of
this head peddle purple rascal altogether pass -PRON- comprehension
ignorance be the parent of fear and be completely nonplus and
confound about the stranger -PRON- confes -PRON- be now as much afraid of -PRON-
as if -PRON- be the devil -PRON- who have thus break into -PRON- room at
the dead of night in fact -PRON- be so afraid of -PRON- that -PRON- be not
game enough just then to address -PRON- and demand a satisfactory answer
concern what seem inexplicable in -PRON-

meanwhile -PRON- continue the business of undress and at last show
-PRON- chest and arm as -PRON- live these covered part of -PRON- be checkered
with the same square as -PRON- face -PRON- back too be all over the same
dark square -PRON- seem to have be in a thirty year war and just
escape from -PRON- with a sticking plaster shirt still more -PRON- very
leg be mark as if a parcel of dark green frog be run up
the trunk of young palm -PRON- be now quite plain that -PRON- must be some
abominable savage or other ship aboard of a whaleman in the south
sea and so land in this christian country -PRON- quake to think of -PRON-
a peddler of head too perhaps the head of -PRON- own brother -PRON- may
take a fancy to -PRON- heaven look at that tomahawk

but there be no time for shuddering for now the savage go about
something that completely fascinate -PRON- attention and convince -PRON- that
-PRON- must indeed be a heathen go to -PRON- heavy grego or wrapall or
dreadnaught which -PRON- have previously hang on a chair -PRON- fumble in the
pocket and produce at length a curious little deformed image with
a hunch on -PRON- back and exactly the colour of a three day old congo
baby remember the embalmed head at first -PRON- almost think that
this black manikin be a real baby preserve in some similar manner but
see that -PRON- be not at all limber and that -PRON- glisten a good deal
like polished ebony -PRON- conclude that -PRON- must be nothing but a wooden
idol which indeed -PRON- prove to be for now the savage go up to the
empty fire place and remove the paper fire board set up this
little hunch back image like a tenpin between the andiron the
chimney jamb and all the brick inside be very sooty so that -PRON-
think this fire place make a very appropriate little shrine or chapel
for -PRON- congo idol

-PRON- now screw -PRON- eye hard towards the half hide image feeling but
ill at ease meantime to see what be next to follow first -PRON- take
about a double handful of shaving out of -PRON- grego pocket and place
-PRON- carefully before the idol then lay a bit of ship biscuit on
top and apply the flame from the lamp -PRON- kindle the shaving into
a sacrificial blaze presently after many hasty snatch into the fire
and still hasty withdrawal of -PRON- finger whereby -PRON- seem to be
scorch -PRON- badly -PRON- at last succeed in draw out the biscuit
then blow off the heat and ash a little -PRON- make a polite offer of
-PRON- to the little negro but the little devil do not seem to fancy such
dry sort of fare at all -PRON- never move -PRON- lip all these strange
antic be accompany by still stranger guttural noise from the
devotee who seem to be pray in a sing song or else sing some
pagan psalmody or other during which -PRON- face twitch about in the
most unnatural manner at last extinguish the fire -PRON- take the idol
up very unceremoniously and bag -PRON- again in -PRON- grego pocket as
carelessly as if -PRON- be a sportsman bag a dead woodcock

all these queer proceeding increase -PRON- uncomfortableness and
see -PRON- now exhibit strong symptom of conclude -PRON- business
operation and jump into bed with -PRON- -PRON- think -PRON- be high time
now or never before the light be put out to break the spell in which
-PRON- have so long be bind

but the interval -PRON- spend in deliberate what to say be a fatal one
take up -PRON- tomahawk from the table -PRON- examine the head of -PRON- for an
instant and then hold -PRON- to the light with -PRON- mouth at the handle
-PRON- puff out great cloud of tobacco smoke the next moment the light
be extinguish and this wild cannibal tomahawk between -PRON- tooth
spring into bed with -PRON- -PRON- sing out -PRON- could not help -PRON- now and give
a sudden grunt of astonishment -PRON- begin feel -PRON-

stammer out something -PRON- know not what -PRON- roll away from -PRON-
against the wall and then conjure -PRON- whoever or whatev -PRON- may
be to keep quiet and let -PRON- get up and light the lamp again but -PRON-
guttural response satisfy -PRON- at once that -PRON- but ill comprehend -PRON-
meaning

who e debel -PRON- -PRON- at last said--"you no speak e dam -PRON- -PRON- kill e
and so say the lighted tomahawk begin flourish about -PRON- in the
dark

landlord for god 's sake peter coffin shout i. landlord watch
coffin angels save -PRON-

speak e tell ee -PRON- who ee be or dam -PRON- -PRON- kill e again growl the
cannibal while -PRON- horrid flourishing of the tomahawk scatter the
hot tobacco ash about -PRON- till -PRON- think -PRON- linen would get on fire
but thank heaven at that moment the landlord come into the room light
in hand and leap from the bed -PRON- run up to -PRON-

do n't be afraid now say -PRON- grin again queequeg here would not
harm a hair of -PRON- head

stop -PRON- grinning shout -PRON- and why do not -PRON- tell -PRON- that that
infernal harpooneer be a cannibal

-PRON- think ye know'd -PRON- didn't -PRON- tell ye -PRON- be a peddlin head
around town but turn fluk again and go to sleep queequeg look
here -PRON- sabbee -PRON- -PRON- sabbee -PRON- this man sleepe -PRON- -PRON- sabbee

-PRON- sabbee plenty grunt queequeg puff away at -PRON- pipe and
sit up in bed

-PRON- gettee in -PRON- add motion to -PRON- with -PRON- tomahawk and
throw the clothe to one side -PRON- really do this in not only a civil
but a really kind and charitable way -PRON- stand look at -PRON- a moment
for all -PRON- tattooing -PRON- be on the whole a clean comely look
cannibal what be all this fuss -PRON- have be make about think -PRON- to
-PRON- the man be a human being just as -PRON- be -PRON- have just as much reason
to fear -PRON- as -PRON- have to be afraid of -PRON- better sleep with a sober
cannibal than a drunken christian

landlord say -PRON- tell -PRON- to stash -PRON- tomahawk there or pipe or
whatev -PRON- call -PRON- tell -PRON- to stop smoking in short and -PRON- will
turn in with -PRON- but -PRON- do not fancy have a man smoke in bed with -PRON-
-PRON- be dangerous besides -PRON- be not insure

this be tell to queequeg -PRON- at once comply and again politely
motion -PRON- to get into bed roll over to one side as much as to
say--"i will not touch a leg of ye

good night landlord say -PRON- -PRON- may go

-PRON- turn in and never sleep better in -PRON- life



chapter 4 the counterpane


upon wake next morning about daylight -PRON- find queequeg 's arm throw
over -PRON- in the most loving and affectionate manner -PRON- have almost
think -PRON- have be -PRON- wife the counterpane be of patchwork full of
odd little parti coloured square and triangle and this arm of -PRON-
tattoo all over with an interminable cretan labyrinth of a figure
no two part of which be of one precise shade owe -PRON- suppose to
-PRON- keep -PRON- arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade -PRON- shirt
sleeve irregularly roll up at various time this same arm of -PRON- -PRON-
say look for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork quilt
indeed partly lie on -PRON- as the arm do when -PRON- first awake -PRON- could
hardly tell -PRON- from the quilt -PRON- so blend -PRON- hue together and
-PRON- be only by the sense of weight and pressure that -PRON- could tell that
queequeg be hug -PRON-

-PRON- sensation be strange let -PRON- try to explain -PRON- when -PRON- be a
child -PRON- well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befall -PRON-
whether -PRON- be a reality or a dream -PRON- never could entirely settle
the circumstance be this -PRON- have be cut up some caper or other -PRON-
think -PRON- be try to crawl up the chimney as -PRON- have see a little
sweep do a few day previous and -PRON- stepmother who somehow or other
be all the time whip -PRON- or send -PRON- to bed supperless -PRON-
mother drag -PRON- by the leg out of the chimney and pack -PRON- off to
bed though -PRON- be only two o'clock in the afternoon of the 21st june
the long day in the year in -PRON- hemisphere -PRON- feel dreadfully but
there be no help for -PRON- so up stair -PRON- go to -PRON- little room in the
third floor undress -PRON- as slowly as possible so as to kill time
and with a bitter sigh get between the sheet

-PRON- lie there dismally calculate that sixteen entire hour must elapse
before -PRON- could hope for a resurrection sixteen hour in bed the
small of -PRON- back ache to think of -PRON- and -PRON- be so light too the
sun shin in at the window and a great rattling of coach in the
street and the sound of gay voice all over the house -PRON- feel bad
and bad at last -PRON- get up dress and softly go down in -PRON-
stocking foot seek out -PRON- stepmother and suddenly throw -PRON-
at -PRON- foot beseech -PRON- as a particular favour to give -PRON- a good
slipper for -PRON- misbehaviour anything indeed but condemn -PRON- to lie
abed such an unendurable length of time but -PRON- be the good and most
conscientious of stepmother and back -PRON- have to go to -PRON- room for
several hour -PRON- lie there broad awake feel a great deal bad than -PRON-
have ever do since even from the great subsequent misfortune at
last -PRON- must have fall into a troubled nightmare of a doze and slowly
wake from -PRON- half steep in dream -PRON- open -PRON- eye and the before
sun light room be now wrap in outer darkness instantly -PRON- feel a shock
run through all -PRON- frame nothing be to be see and nothing be
to be hear but a supernatural hand seem place in mine -PRON- arm hang
over the counterpane and the nameless unimaginable silent form
or phantom to which the hand belong seem closely seat by -PRON-
bed side for what seem age pile on age -PRON- lie there freeze with
the most awful fear not dare to drag away -PRON- hand yet ever think
that if -PRON- could but stir -PRON- one single inch the horrid spell would be
break -PRON- know not how this consciousness at last glide away from -PRON-
but wake in the morning -PRON- shudderingly remember -PRON- all and for
day and week and month afterwards -PRON- lose -PRON- in confound
attempt to explain the mystery nay to this very hour -PRON- often puzzle
-PRON- with -PRON-

now take away the awful fear and -PRON- sensation at feel the
supernatural hand in mine be very similar in -PRON- strangeness to
those which -PRON- experience on wake up and see queequeg 's pagan
arm throw round -PRON- but at length all the past night 's event soberly
recur one by one in fix reality and then -PRON- lie only alive to
the comical predicament for though -PRON- try to move -PRON- arm unlock -PRON-
bridegroom clasp yet sleep as -PRON- be -PRON- still hug -PRON- tightly
as though naught but death should part -PRON- twain -PRON- now strive to rouse
him--"queequeg!"--but -PRON- only answer be a snore -PRON- then roll over
-PRON- neck feeling as if -PRON- be in a horse collar and suddenly feel a
slight scratch throw aside the counterpane there lie the tomahawk
sleep by the savage 's side as if -PRON- be a hatchet faced baby a
pretty pickle truly think -PRON- ab here in a strange house in the
broad day with a cannibal and a tomahawk queequeg!--in the name of
goodness queequeg wake at length by dint of much wriggling and
loud and incessant expostulation upon the unbecomingness of -PRON-
hug a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style -PRON- succeed in
extract a grunt and presently -PRON- draw back -PRON- arm shake -PRON-
all over like a newfoundland dog just from the water and sit up in bed
stiff as a pike staff look at -PRON- and rub -PRON- eye as if -PRON-
do not altogether remember how -PRON- come to be there though a dim
consciousness of know something about -PRON- seem slowly dawn over
-PRON- meanwhile -PRON- lie quietly eye -PRON- have no serious misgiving
now and bent upon narrowly observe so curious a creature when at
last -PRON- mind seem make up touch the character of -PRON- bedfellow
and -PRON- become as -PRON- be reconcile to the fact -PRON- jump out upon
the floor and by certain sign and sound give -PRON- to understand that
if -PRON- please -PRON- -PRON- would dress first and then leave -PRON- to dress
afterwards leave the whole apartment to -PRON- think -PRON- queequeg
under the circumstance this be a very civilized overture but the
truth be these savage have an innate sense of delicacy say what
-PRON- will -PRON- be marvellous how essentially polite -PRON- be -PRON- pay this
particular compliment to queequeg because -PRON- treat -PRON- with so much
civility and consideration while -PRON- be guilty of great rudeness
star at -PRON- from the bed and watch all -PRON- toilette motion for
the time -PRON- curiosity get the good of -PRON- breeding nevertheless
a man like queequeg -PRON- do not see every day -PRON- and -PRON- way be well
worth unusual regarding

-PRON- commence dress at top by don -PRON- beaver hat a very tall one
by the by and then still minus -PRON- trowser -PRON- hunt up -PRON- boot
what under the heaven -PRON- do -PRON- for -PRON- can not tell but -PRON- next
movement be to crush -PRON- boot in hand and hat on under the bed
when from sundry violent gasping and straining -PRON- infer -PRON- be
hard at work boot -PRON- though by no law of propriety that -PRON- ever
hear of be any man require to be private when put on -PRON-
boot but queequeg do -PRON- see be a creature in the transition
stage neither caterpillar nor butterfly -PRON- be just enough civilize
to show off -PRON- outlandishness in the strange possible manner -PRON-
education be not yet complete -PRON- be an undergraduate if -PRON- have not
be a small degree civilized -PRON- very probably would not have trouble
-PRON- with boot at all but then if -PRON- have not be still a savage
-PRON- never would have dreamt of get under the bed to put -PRON- on at
last -PRON- emerge with -PRON- hat very much dent and crush down over -PRON-
eye and begin creak and limp about the room as if not
be much accustom to boot -PRON- pair of damp wrinkled cowhide
one probably not make to order either rather pinched and torment
-PRON- at the first go off of a bitter cold morning

see now that there be no curtain to the window and that the
street be very narrow the house opposite command a plain view
into the room and observe more and more the indecorous figure that
queequeg make stave about with little else but -PRON- hat and boot on
-PRON- beg -PRON- as well as -PRON- could to accelerate -PRON- toilet somewhat
and particularly to get into -PRON- pantaloon as soon as possible -PRON-
comply and then proceed to wash -PRON- at that time in the
morning any christian would have wash -PRON- face but queequeg to
-PRON- amazement content -PRON- with restrict -PRON- ablution to -PRON-
chest arm and hand -PRON- then don -PRON- waistcoat and take up a
piece of hard soap on the wash stand centre table dip -PRON- into water
and commence lather -PRON- face -PRON- be watch to see where -PRON- keep
-PRON- razor when lo and behold -PRON- take the harpoon from the bed corner
slip out the long wooden stock unsheathe the head whet -PRON- a little
on -PRON- boot and stride up to the bit of mirror against the wall
begin a vigorous scraping or rather harpooning of -PRON- cheek think
-PRON- queequeg this be use rogers 's good cutlery with a vengeance
afterwards -PRON- wonder the less at this operation when -PRON- come to know of
what fine steel the head of a harpoon be make and how exceedingly sharp
the long straight edge be always keep

the rest of -PRON- toilet be soon achieve and -PRON- proudly march out of
the room wrap up in -PRON- great pilot monkey jacket and sport -PRON-
harpoon like a marshal 's baton



chapter 5 breakfast


-PRON- quickly follow suit and descend into the bar room accost the
grin landlord very pleasantly -PRON- cherish no malice towards -PRON-
though -PRON- have be skylark with -PRON- not a little in the matter of -PRON-
bedfellow

however a good laugh be a mighty good thing and rather too scarce a
good thing the more be the pity so if any one man in -PRON- own
proper person afford stuff for a good joke to anybody let -PRON- not be
backward but let -PRON- cheerfully allow -PRON- to spend and be spend in
that way and the man that have anything bountifully laughable about -PRON-
be sure there be more in that man than -PRON- perhaps think for

the bar room be now full of the boarder who have be drop in the
night previous and whom -PRON- have not as yet have a good look at -PRON- be
nearly all whaleman chief mate and second mate and third mate and
sea carpenter and sea cooper and sea blacksmith and harpooneer
and ship keeper a brown and brawny company with bosky beard an
unshorn shaggy set all wear monkey jacket for morning gown

-PRON- could pretty plainly tell how long each one have be ashore this
young fellow 's healthy cheek be like a sun toast pear in hue and
would seem to smell almost as musky -PRON- can not have be three day
land from -PRON- indian voyage that man next -PRON- look a few shade
light -PRON- may say a touch of satin wood be in -PRON- in the
complexion of a third still linger a tropic tawn but slightly bleach
withal he doubtless have tarry whole week ashore but who could show
a cheek like queequeg which bar with various tint seem like the
ande western slope to show forth in one array contrast climate
zone by zone

grub ho now cry the landlord fling open a door and in -PRON- go
to breakfast

-PRON- say that man who have see the world thereby become quite at ease
in manner quite self possess in company not always though ledyard
the great new england traveller and mungo park the scotch one of all
man -PRON- possess the least assurance in the parlor but perhaps the
mere crossing of siberia in a sledge draw by dog as ledyard do or
the take a long solitary walk on an empty stomach in the negro heart
of africa which be the sum of poor mungo 's performance this kind of
travel -PRON- say may not be the very good mode of attain a high social
polish still for the most part that sort of thing be to be have
anywhere

these reflection just here be occasion by the circumstance that
after -PRON- be all seat at the table and -PRON- be prepare to hear some
good story about whaling to -PRON- no small surprise nearly every
man maintain a profound silence and not only that but -PRON- look
embarrassed yes here be a set of sea dog many of whom without the
slight bashfulness have board great whale on the high sea entire
stranger to -PRON- and duel -PRON- dead without wink and yet here
-PRON- sit at a social breakfast table all of the same calling all of
kindred taste look round as sheepishly at each other as though -PRON-
have never be out of sight of some sheepfold among the green mountains
a curious sight these bashful bear these timid warrior whaleman

but as for queequeg why queequeg sit there among -PRON- at the head of
the table too -PRON- so chance as cool as an icicle to be sure -PRON- can not
say much for -PRON- breeding -PRON- great admirer could not have cordially
justify -PRON- bring -PRON- harpoon into breakfast with -PRON- and use -PRON-
there without ceremony reach over the table with -PRON- to the imminent
jeopardy of many head and grapple the beefsteak towards -PRON- but
that be certainly very coolly do by -PRON- and every one know that in
most people 's estimation to do anything coolly be to do -PRON- genteelly

-PRON- will not speak of all queequeg 's peculiarity here how -PRON- eschew
coffee and hot roll and apply -PRON- undivided attention to beefsteak
do rare enough that when breakfast be over -PRON- withdraw like the
rest into the public room light -PRON- tomahawk pipe and be sit
there quietly digest and smoke with -PRON- inseparable hat on when -PRON-
sally out for a stroll



chapter 6 the street


if -PRON- have be astonish at first catch a glimpse of so outlandish
an individual as queequeg circulate among the polite society of a
civilized town that astonishment soon depart upon take -PRON- first
daylight stroll through the street of new bedford

in thoroughfare nigh the dock any considerable seaport will
frequently offer to view the queerest look nondescript from foreign
part even in broadway and chestnut street mediterranean mariner
will sometimes jostle the affrighted lady regent street be not
unknown to lascars and malays and at bombay in the apollo green live
yankees have often scar the native but new bedford beat all water
street and wapping in these last mention haunt -PRON- see only sailor
but in new bedford actual cannibal stand chat at street corner
savage outright many of whom yet carry on -PRON- bone unholy flesh -PRON-
make a strange stare

but besides the feegeeans tongatobooarrs erromanggoans pannangians
and brighggians and besides the wild specimen of the whaling craft
which unheed reel about the street -PRON- will see other sight still
more curious certainly more comical there weekly arrive in this town
score of green vermonter and new hampshire man all athirst for gain
and glory in the fishery -PRON- be mostly young of stalwart frame
fellow who have fell forest and now seek to drop the axe and snatch
the whale lance many be as green as the green mountains whence -PRON-
come in some thing -PRON- would think -PRON- but a few hour old look
there that chap strut round the corner -PRON- wear a beaver hat and
swallow tail coat girdle with a sailor belt and sheath knife here
come another with a sou'-wester and a bombazine cloak

no town breed dandy will compare with a country breed one -PRON- mean a
downright bumpkin dandy a fellow that in the dog day will mow -PRON-
two acre in buckskin glove for fear of tan -PRON- hand now when a
country dandy like this take -PRON- into -PRON- head to make a distinguished
reputation and join the great whale fishery -PRON- should see the
comical thing -PRON- do upon reach the seaport in bespeak -PRON-
sea outfit -PRON- order bell button to -PRON- waistcoat strap to -PRON-
canvas trowser ah poor hay seed how bitterly will burst those strap
in the first howl gale when thou art drive strap button and
all down the throat of the tempest

but think not that this famous town have only harpooneer cannibal and
bumpkin to show -PRON- visitor not at all still new bedford be a queer
place have -PRON- not be for -PRON- whalemen that tract of land would this
day perhaps have be in as howl condition as the coast of labrador
as -PRON- be part of -PRON- back country be enough to frighten one -PRON-
look so bony the town -PRON- be perhaps the dear place to live
in in all new england -PRON- be a land of oil true enough but not like
canaan a land also of corn and wine the street do not run with
milk nor in the spring time do -PRON- pave -PRON- with fresh egg yet in
spite of this nowhere in all america will -PRON- find more patrician like
house park and garden more opulent than in new bedford whence come
-PRON- how plant upon this once scraggy scoria of a country

go and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoon round yonder lofty
mansion and -PRON- question will be answer yes all these brave house
and flowery garden come from the atlantic pacific and indian ocean
one and all -PRON- be harpoon and drag up hither from the bottom
of the sea can herr alexander perform a feat like that

in new bedford father -PRON- say give whale for dower to -PRON-

in summer time the town be sweet to see full of fine maple long
avenue of green and gold and in august high in air the beautiful and
bountiful horse chestnut candelabra wise proffer the passer by -PRON-
taper upright cone of congregate blossom so omnipotent be art
which in many a district of new bedford have superinduc bright terrace
of flower upon the barren refuse rock throw aside at creation 's final
day

and the woman of new bedford -PRON- bloom like -PRON- own red rose but
rose only bloom in summer whereas the fine carnation of -PRON- cheek
be perennial as sunlight in the seventh heaven elsewhere match that
bloom of -PRON- ye can not save in salem where -PRON- tell -PRON- the young
girl breathe such musk -PRON- sailor sweetheart smell -PRON- mile off
shore as though -PRON- be draw nigh the odorous moluccas instead of
the puritanic sand



chapter 7 the chapel


in this same new bedford there stand a whaleman 's chapel and few be
the moody fisherman shortly bind for the indian ocean or pacific who
fail to make a sunday visit to the spot -PRON- be sure that -PRON- do not

return from -PRON- first morning stroll -PRON- again sally out upon this
special errand the sky have change from clear sunny cold to drive
sleet and mist wrap -PRON- in -PRON- shaggy jacket of the cloth call
bearskin -PRON- fight -PRON- way against the stubborn storm enter -PRON-
find a small scatter congregation of sailor and sailor wife and
widow a muffled silence reign only break at time by the shriek
of the storm each silent worshipper seem purposely sit apart from
the other as if each silent grief be insular and incommunicable the
chaplain have not yet arrive and there these silent island of man and
woman sit steadfastly eye several marble tablet with black border
mason into the wall on either side the pulpit three of -PRON- run
something like the follow but -PRON- do not pretend to quote:--

sacred to the memory of john talbot who at the age of eighteen be
lose overboard near the isle of desolation off patagonia november
1st 1836 this tablet be erect to -PRON- memory by his sister

sacred to the memory of robert long willis ellery nathan coleman
walter canny seth macy and samuel gleig form one of the boat
crew of the ship eliza who be tow out of sight by a whale on the
off shore ground in the pacific december 31st 1839 this marble be
here place by -PRON- survive shipmate

sacred to the memory of the late captain ezekiel hardy who in the bow
of -PRON- boat be kill by a sperm whale on the coast of japan august
3d 1833 this tablet be erect to -PRON- memory by his widow

shake off the sleet from -PRON- ice glaze hat and jacket -PRON- seat -PRON-
near the door and turn sideway be surprised to see queequeg near
-PRON- affect by the solemnity of the scene there be a wonder gaze
of incredulous curiosity in -PRON- countenance this savage be the only
person present who seem to notice -PRON- entrance because -PRON- be the only
one who could not read and therefore be not read those frigid
inscription on the wall whether any of the relative of the seaman
whose name appear there be now among the congregation -PRON- know not
but so many be the unrecorded accident in the fishery and so plainly
do several woman present wear the countenance if not the trapping
of some unceasing grief that -PRON- feel sure that here before -PRON- be
assemble those in whose unhealing heart the sight of those bleak
tablet sympathetically cause the old wound to bleed afresh

oh ye whose dead lie bury beneath the green grass who stand among
flower can say here here lie -PRON- beloved ye know not the desolation
that brood in bosom like these what bitter blank in those
black border marble which cover no ash what despair in those
immovable inscription what deadly void and unbidden infidelity in
the line that seem to gnaw upon all faith and refuse resurrection to
the being who have placelessly perish without a grave as well may
those tablet stand in the cave of elephanta as here

in what census of live creature the dead of mankind be include
why -PRON- be that a universal proverb say of -PRON- that -PRON- tell no
tale though contain more secret than the goodwin sands how -PRON- be
that to -PRON- name who yesterday depart for the other world -PRON- prefix
so significant and infidel a word and yet do not thus entitle -PRON- if
-PRON- but embark for the remotest indies of this live earth why the
life insurance companies pay death forfeiture upon immortal in what
eternal unstirr paralysis and deadly hopeless trance yet lie
antique adam who die sixty round century ago how -PRON- be that -PRON-
still refuse to be comfort for those who -PRON- nevertheless maintain be
dwell in unspeakable bliss why all the living so strive to hush all
the dead wherefore but the rumor of a knock in a tomb will terrify a
whole city all these thing be not without -PRON- meaning

but faith like a jackal feed among the tomb and even from these
dead doubt -PRON- gather -PRON- most vital hope

-PRON- need scarcely to be tell with what feeling on the eve of a
nantucket voyage -PRON- regard those marble tablet and by the murky
light of that darkened doleful day read the fate of the whaleman
who have go before -PRON- yes ishmael the same fate may be thine but
somehow -PRON- grow merry again delightful inducement to embark fine
chance for promotion -PRON- seem aye a stove boat will make -PRON- an
immortal by brevet yes there be death in this business of whaling a
speechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into eternity but what
then methink -PRON- have hugely mistaken this matter of life and death
methink that what -PRON- call -PRON- shadow here on earth be -PRON- true
substance methink that in look at thing spiritual -PRON- be too
much like oyster observe the sun through the water and think that
thick water the thin of air methinks -PRON- body be but the lee of -PRON-
better be in fact take -PRON- body who will take -PRON- -PRON- say -PRON- be not
-PRON- and therefore three cheer for nantucket and come a stove boat and
stove body when -PRON- will for stave -PRON- soul jove -PRON- can not



chapter 8 the pulpit


-PRON- have not be seat very long ere a man of a certain venerable
robustness enter immediately as the storm pelt door fly back upon
admit -PRON- a quick regardful eyeing of -PRON- by all the congregation
sufficiently attest that this fine old man be the chaplain yes -PRON-
be the famous father mapple so call by the whaleman among whom -PRON-
be a very great favourite -PRON- have be a sailor and a harpooneer in -PRON-
youth but for many year past have dedicate -PRON- life to the ministry
at the time -PRON- now write of father mapple be in the hardy winter of a
healthy old age that sort of old age which seem merge into a second
flower youth for among all the fissure of -PRON- wrinkle there shine
certain mild gleam of a newly develop bloom the spring verdure
peep forth even beneath february 's snow no one have previously
hear -PRON- history could for the first time behold father mapple without
the utmost interest because there be certain engrafted clerical
peculiarity about -PRON- imputable to that adventurous maritime life
-PRON- have lead when -PRON- enter -PRON- observe that -PRON- carry no umbrella and
certainly have not come in -PRON- carriage for -PRON- tarpaulin hat run down
with melt sleet and -PRON- great pilot cloth jacket seem almost to
drag -PRON- to the floor with the weight of the water -PRON- have absorb
however hat and coat and overshoe be one by one remove and hang up
in a little space in an adjacent corner when array in a decent suit
-PRON- quietly approach the pulpit

like most old fashion pulpit -PRON- be a very lofty one and since a
regular stair to such a height would by -PRON- long angle with the floor
seriously contract the already small area of the chapel the architect
-PRON- seem have act upon the hint of father mapple and finish the
pulpit without a stairs substitute a perpendicular side ladder like
those use in mount a ship from a boat at sea the wife of a whaling
captain have provide the chapel with a handsome pair of red worst
man rope for this ladder which be -PRON- nicely head and
stain with a mahogany colour the whole contrivance consider what
manner of chapel -PRON- be seem by no mean in bad taste halt for
an instant at the foot of the ladder and with both hand grasp the
ornamental knob of the man rope father mapple cast a look upwards
and then with a truly sailor like but still reverential dexterity hand
over hand mount the step as if ascend the main top of -PRON- vessel

the perpendicular part of this side ladder as be usually the case with
swing one be of cloth cover rope only the round be of wood
so that at every step there be a joint at -PRON- first glimpse of the
pulpit -PRON- have not escape -PRON- that however convenient for a ship
these joint in the present instance seem unnecessary for -PRON- be not
prepared to see father mapple after gain the height slowly turn
round and stoop over the pulpit deliberately drag up the ladder
step by step till the whole be deposit within leave -PRON-
impregnable in -PRON- little quebec

-PRON- ponder some time without fully comprehend the reason for this
father mapple enjoy such a wide reputation for sincerity and sanctity
that -PRON- could not suspect -PRON- of court notoriety by any mere trick
of the stage no think -PRON- there must be some sober reason for this
thing furthermore -PRON- must symbolize something unseen can -PRON- be
then that by that act of physical isolation -PRON- signify -PRON- spiritual
withdrawal for the time from all outward worldly tie and connexion
yes for replenish with the meat and wine of the word to the faithful
man of god this pulpit -PRON- see be a self contain stronghold a lofty
ehrenbreitstein with a perennial well of water within the wall

but the side ladder be not the only strange feature of the place
borrow from the chaplain 's former sea faring between the marble
cenotaph on either hand of the pulpit the wall which form -PRON- back
be adorn with a large painting represent a gallant ship beat
against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rock and snowy
breaker but high above the fly scud and dark roll cloud there
float a little isle of sunlight from which beam forth an angel 's
face and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the
ship 's toss deck something like that silver plate now insert into
the victory 's plank where nelson fall ah noble ship the angel
seem to say beat on beat on thou noble ship and bear a hardy
helm for lo the sun be break through the cloud be roll
off serene azure be at hand

nor be the pulpit -PRON- without a trace of the same sea taste that
have achieve the ladder and the picture -PRON- panelled front be in
the likeness of a ship 's bluff bow and the holy bible rest on a
project piece of scroll work fashion after a ship 's fiddle head
beak

what could be more full of meaning for the pulpit be ever this earth 's
foremost part all the rest come in -PRON- rear the pulpit lead the
world from thence -PRON- be the storm of god 's quick wrath be first
descry and the bow must bear the early brunt from thence -PRON- be
the god of breeze fair or foul be first invoke for favourable wind
yes the world 's a ship on -PRON- passage out and not a voyage complete
and the pulpit be -PRON- prow



chapter 9 the sermon


father mapple rise and in a mild voice of unassum authority order
the scattered people to condense starboard gangway there side away
to larboard larboard gangway to starboard midship midship

there be a low rumbling of heavy sea boot among the bench and a
still slighter shuffling of woman 's shoe and all be quiet again and
every eye on the preacher

-PRON- pause a little then kneel in the pulpit 's bow fold -PRON- large
brown hand across -PRON- chest uplift -PRON- closed eye and offer
a prayer so deeply devout that -PRON- seem kneel and pray at the
bottom of the sea

this end in prolong solemn tone like the continual tolling of
a bell in a ship that be founder at sea in a fog in such tone -PRON-
commence read the follow hymn but change -PRON- manner towards
the concluding stanzas burst forth with a pealing exultation and joy--

the rib and terror in the whale
arch over -PRON- a dismal gloom
while all god 's sun light wave roll by
and lift -PRON- deepen down to doom

-PRON- see the opening maw of hell
with endless pain and sorrow there
which none but -PRON- that feel can tell--
oh -PRON- be plunge to despair

in black distress -PRON- call -PRON- god
when -PRON- could scarce believe -PRON- -PRON-
-PRON- bow -PRON- ear to -PRON- complaints--
no more the whale do -PRON- confine

with speed -PRON- fly to -PRON- relief
as on a radiant dolphin bear
awful yet bright as lightning shine
the face of -PRON- deliverer god

-PRON- song for ever shall record
that terrible that joyful hour
-PRON- give the glory to -PRON- god
-PRON- all the mercy and the power


nearly all join in sing this hymn which swell high above the
howling of the storm a brief pause ensued the preacher slowly turn
over the leaf of the bible and at last fold -PRON- hand down upon
the proper page say beloved shipmate clinch the last verse of the
first chapter of jonah--'and god have prepare a great fish to swallow up
jonah

shipmate this book contain only four chapter four yarn be one
of the small strand in the mighty cable of the scripture yet what
depth of the soul do jonah 's deep sealine sound what a pregnant
lesson to -PRON- be this prophet what a noble thing be that canticle in the
fish 's belly how billow like and boisterously grand -PRON- feel the flood
surge over -PRON- -PRON- sound with -PRON- to the kelpy bottom of the water
sea weed and all the slime of the sea be about -PRON- but what be this
lesson that the book of jonah teach shipmate -PRON- be a two strand
lesson a lesson to -PRON- all as sinful man and a lesson to -PRON- as a pilot
of the live god as sinful man -PRON- be a lesson to -PRON- all because -PRON-
be a story of the sin hard heartedness suddenly awakened fear the
swift punishment repentance prayer and finally the deliverance and
joy of jonah as with all sinner among man the sin of this son of
amittai be in -PRON- wilful disobedience of the command of god never
mind now what that command be or how convey which -PRON- find a hard
command but all the thing that god would have -PRON- do be hard for -PRON- to
do remember that and hence -PRON- oftener command -PRON- than endeavor to
persuade and if -PRON- obey god -PRON- must disobey -PRON- and -PRON- be in
this disobey -PRON- wherein the hardness of obey god consist

with this sin of disobedience in -PRON- jonah still further flout at
god by seek to flee from him -PRON- think that a ship make by man will
carry -PRON- into country where god do not reign but only the captain
of this earth -PRON- skulk about the wharf of joppa and seek a ship
that be bind for tarshish there lurk perhaps a hitherto unheeded
mean here by all account tarshish could have be no other city
than the modern cadiz that be the opinion of learn man and where be
cadiz shipmate cadiz be in spain as far by water from joppa
as jonah could possibly have sail in those ancient day when the
atlantic be an almost unknown sea because joppa the modern jaffa
shipmate be on the most easterly coast of the mediterranean the
syrian and tarshish or cadiz more than two thousand mile to the
westward from that just outside the straits of gibraltar see ye
not then shipmate that jonah seek to flee world wide from god
miserable man oh most contemptible and worthy of all scorn with
slouch hat and guilty eye skulk from -PRON- god prowl among the
shipping like a vile burglar hasten to cross the sea so disordered
self condemn be -PRON- look that have there be policeman in those
day jonah on the mere suspicion of something wrong have be arrest
ere -PRON- touch a deck how plainly -PRON- be a fugitive no baggage not a
hat box valise or carpet bag no friend accompany -PRON- to the wharf
with -PRON- adieux at last after much dodge search -PRON- find the
tarshish ship receive the last item of -PRON- cargo and as -PRON- step on
board to see -PRON- captain in the cabin all the sailor for the moment
desist from hoist in the good to mark the stranger 's evil eye
jonah see this but in vain -PRON- try to look all ease and confidence
in vain essay -PRON- wretched smile strong intuition of the man assure
the mariner -PRON- can be no innocent in -PRON- gamesome but still serious
way one whisper to the other--"jack -PRON- be rob a widow or joe
do -PRON- mark -PRON- -PRON- be a bigamist or harry lad -PRON- gues -PRON- be the
adulterer that break jail in old gomorrah or belike one of the miss
murderer from sodom another run to read the bill that be stick
against the spile upon the wharf to which the ship be moor offer
five hundred gold coin for the apprehension of a parricide and
contain a description of -PRON- person -PRON- read and look from jonah
to the bill while all -PRON- sympathetic shipmate now crowd round jonah
prepare to lay -PRON- hand upon -PRON- frighted jonah tremble and
summon all -PRON- boldness to -PRON- face only look so much the more a
coward -PRON- will not confess -PRON- suspect but that -PRON- be strong
suspicion so -PRON- make the good of -PRON- and when the sailor find -PRON-
not to be the man that be advertise -PRON- let -PRON- pass and -PRON- descend
into the cabin

who be there cry the captain at -PRON- busy desk hurriedly make
out -PRON- paper for the customs--'who 's there oh how that harmless
question mangle jonah for the instant -PRON- almost turn to flee again
but -PRON- rally -PRON- seek a passage in this ship to tarshish how soon
sail ye sir thus far the busy captain have not look up to jonah
though the man now stand before -PRON- but no sooner do -PRON- hear that
hollow voice than -PRON- dart a scrutinize glance -PRON- sail with the
next come tide at last -PRON- slowly answer still intently eye
-PRON- no sooner sir?'--'soon enough for any honest man that go a
passenger ha jonah that be another stab but -PRON- swiftly call away
the captain from that scent -PRON- 'll sail with ye,'--he says,--'the
passage money how much be that i'll pay now for -PRON- be particularly
write shipmate as if -PRON- be a thing not to be overlook in this
history that -PRON- pay the fare thereof ere the craft do sail and
take with the context this be full of meaning

now jonah 's captain shipmate be one whose discernment detect crime
in any but whose cupidity expose -PRON- only in the penniless in this
world shipmate sin that pay -PRON- way can travel freely and without
a passport whereas virtue if a pauper be stop at all frontier
so jonah 's captain prepare to test the length of jonah 's purse ere -PRON-
judge -PRON- openly -PRON- charge -PRON- thrice the usual sum and -PRON- be assent
to then the captain know that jonah be a fugitive but at the same
time resolve to help a flight that pave -PRON- rear with gold yet when
jonah fairly take out -PRON- purse prudent suspicion still molest the
captain -PRON- ring every coin to find a counterfeit not a forger any
way -PRON- mutter and jonah be put down for -PRON- passage point out -PRON-
state room sir say jonah now -PRON- 'm travel weary -PRON- ne sleep
thou look like -PRON- say the captain there be thy room jonah
enter and would lock the door but the lock contain no key hear
-PRON- foolishly fumble there the captain laugh lowly to -PRON- and
mutter something about the door of convict cell be never allow
to be lock within all dress and dusty as -PRON- be jonah throw
-PRON- into -PRON- berth and find the little state room ceiling almost
rest on -PRON- forehead the air be close and jonah gasp then in
that contract hole sink too beneath the ship 's water line jonah
feel the herald presentiment of that stifle hour when the whale
shall hold -PRON- in the small of -PRON- bowel ward

screw at -PRON- axis against the side a swing lamp slightly
oscillate in jonah 's room and the ship heel over towards the wharf
with the weight of the last bale receive the lamp flame and all
though in slight motion still maintain a permanent obliquity with
reference to the room though in truth infallibly straight -PRON- -PRON-
but make obvious the false lying level among which -PRON- hang the lamp
alarm and frighten jonah as lie in -PRON- berth -PRON- torment eye
roll round the place and this thus far successful fugitive find no
refuge for -PRON- restless glance but that contradiction in the lamp more
and more appal -PRON- the floor the ceiling and the side be all awry
oh so -PRON- conscience hang in -PRON- -PRON- groan straight upwards so -PRON-
burn but the chamber of -PRON- soul be all in crookedness

like one who after a night of drunken revelry hie to -PRON- bed still
reel but with conscience yet prick -PRON- as the plunging of the
roman race horse but so much the more strike -PRON- steel tag into -PRON- as
one who in that miserable plight still turn and turn in giddy anguish
pray god for annihilation until the fit be pass and at last amid
the whirl of woe -PRON- feel a deep stupor steal over -PRON- as over the
man who bleed to death for conscience be the wound and there be naught
to staunch -PRON- so after sore wrestling in -PRON- berth jonah 's prodigy
of ponderous misery drag -PRON- drown down to sleep

and now the time of tide have come the ship cast off -PRON- cable and
from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for tarshish all careen
glide to sea that ship -PRON- friend be the first of record
smuggler the contraband be jonah but the sea rebel -PRON- will not
bear the wicked burden a dreadful storm come on the ship be like to
break but now when the boatswain call all hand to lighten -PRON-
when box bale and jar be clatter overboard when the wind
be shrieking and the man be yell and every plank thunder with
trample foot right over jonah 's head in all this rag tumult jonah
sleep -PRON- hideous sleep -PRON- see no black sky and rag sea feel not
the reel timber and little hear -PRON- or heed -PRON- the far rush of the
mighty whale which even now with open mouth be cleave the sea after
-PRON- aye shipmate jonah be go down into the side of the ship a
berth in the cabin as -PRON- have take -PRON- and be fast asleep but the
frightened master come to -PRON- and shriek in -PRON- dead ear what
mean thou o sleeper arise startle from -PRON- lethargy by that
direful cry jonah stagger to -PRON- foot and stumble to the deck
grasp a shroud to look out upon the sea but at that moment -PRON- be
spring upon by a panther billow leap over the bulwark wave after
wave thus leap into the ship and find no speedy vent run roar
fore and aft till the mariner come nigh to drown while yet afloat
and ever as the white moon show -PRON- affrighted face from the steep
gully in the blackness overhead aghast jonah see the rear
bowsprit point high upward but soon beat downward again towards the
torment deep

terror upon terror run shout through -PRON- soul in all -PRON- cringing
attitude the god fugitive be now too plainly known the sailor mark
-PRON- more and more certain grow -PRON- suspicion of -PRON- and at last
fully to test the truth by refer the whole matter to high heaven
-PRON- fall to cast lot to see for whose cause this great tempest be
upon -PRON- the lot be jonah 's that discover then how furiously -PRON-
mob -PRON- with -PRON- question what be thine occupation whence com
thou thy country what people but mark now -PRON- shipmate the behavior
of poor jonah the eager mariner but ask -PRON- who -PRON- be and where
from wherea -PRON- not only receive an answer to those question
but likewise another answer to a question not put by -PRON- but the
unsolicited answer be force from jonah by the hard hand of god that be
upon -PRON-

-PRON- be a hebrew -PRON- cry and then--'i fear the lord the god of heaven
who hath make the sea and the dry land fear -PRON- o jonah aye well
mightest thou fear the lord god then straightway -PRON- now go on to
make a full confession whereupon the mariner become more and more
appalled but still be pitiful for when jonah not yet supplicate
god for mercy since -PRON- but too well know the darkness of -PRON-
desert when wretched jonah cry out to -PRON- to take -PRON- and cast -PRON-
forth into the sea for -PRON- know that for his sake this great tempest
be upon -PRON- -PRON- mercifully turn from -PRON- and seek by other mean to
save the ship but all in vain the indignant gale howl louder
then with one hand raise invokingly to god with the other -PRON- not
unreluctantly lie hold of jonah

and now behold jonah take up as an anchor and drop into the sea
when instantly an oily calmness float out from the east and the sea
be still as jonah carry down the gale with -PRON- leave smooth
water behind -PRON- go down in the whirl heart of such a masterless
commotion that -PRON- scarce heed the moment when -PRON- drop seethe into
the yawn jaws await -PRON- and the whale shoot to all -PRON- ivory
tooth like so many white bolt upon -PRON- prison then jonah pray unto
the lord out of the fish 's belly but observe -PRON- prayer and learn a
weighty lesson for sinful as -PRON- be jonah do not weep and wail for
direct deliverance -PRON- feel that -PRON- dreadful punishment be just -PRON-
leave all -PRON- deliverance to god content -PRON- with this that
spite of all -PRON- pain and pang -PRON- will still look towards -PRON- holy
temple and here shipmate be true and faithful repentance not
clamorous for pardon but grateful for punishment and how pleasing to
god be this conduct in jonah be show in the eventual deliverance of
-PRON- from the sea and the whale shipmate -PRON- do not place jonah before
-PRON- to be copy for -PRON- sin but -PRON- do place -PRON- before -PRON- as a model
for repentance sin not but if -PRON- do take heed to repent of -PRON- like
jonah

while -PRON- be speak these word the howling of the shrieking
slant storm without seem to add new power to the preacher who
when describe jonah 's sea storm seem toss by a storm -PRON-
-PRON- deep chest heave as with a ground swell -PRON- toss arm seem the
war element at work and the thunder that roll away from off -PRON-
swarthy brow and the light leap from -PRON- eye make all -PRON- simple
hearer look on -PRON- with a quick fear that be strange to -PRON-

there now come a lull in -PRON- look as -PRON- silently turn over the leaf
of the book once more and at last stand motionless with closed
eye for the moment seem commune with god and -PRON-

but again -PRON- lean over towards the people and bow -PRON- head lowly
with an aspect of the deep yet manly humility -PRON- spake these
word

shipmate god have lay but one hand upon -PRON- both -PRON- hand press
upon -PRON- -PRON- have read ye by what murky light may be -PRON- the lesson that
jonah teach to all sinner and therefore to ye and still more to -PRON-
for -PRON- be a great sinner than ye and now how gladly would -PRON- come down
from this mast head and sit on the hatch there where -PRON- sit and
listen as -PRON- listen while some one of -PRON- read me that other and more
awful lesson which jonah teach to me as a pilot of the live god
how be an anoint pilot prophet or speaker of true thing and
bidden by the lord to sound those unwelcome truth in the ear of a
wicked nineveh jonah appal at the hostility -PRON- should raise flee
from -PRON- mission and seek to escape -PRON- duty and -PRON- god by take
ship at joppa but god be everywhere tarshish -PRON- never reach as -PRON-
have see god come upon -PRON- in the whale and swallow -PRON- down to
live gulfs of doom and with swift slanting tear -PRON- along into the
midst of the sea where the eddying depth suck -PRON- ten thousand
fathom down and the weed be wrap about -PRON- head and all the
watery world of woe bowl over -PRON- yet even then beyond the reach of
any plummet--'out of the belly of hell'--when the whale ground upon
the ocean 's utmost bone even then god hear the engulphed repent
prophet when -PRON- cry then god spake unto the fish and from the
shudder cold and blackness of the sea the whale come breech
up towards the warm and pleasant sun and all the delight of air and
earth and vomit out jonah upon the dry land when the word of the
lord come a second time and jonah bruise and beat -PRON- ear like
two sea shell still multitudinously murmur of the ocean jonah
do the almighty 's bidding and what be that shipmate to preach the
truth to the face of falsehood that be -PRON-

this shipmate this be that other lesson and woe to that pilot of
the live god who slight -PRON- woe to -PRON- whom this world charm from
gospel duty woe to -PRON- who seek to pour oil upon the water when god
have brew -PRON- into a gale woe to -PRON- who seek to please rather than
to appal woe to -PRON- whose good name be more to -PRON- than goodness woe
to -PRON- who in this world court not dishonour woe to -PRON- who would
not be true even though to be false be salvation yea woe to -PRON-
who as the great pilot paul have -PRON- while preach to other be
-PRON- a castaway

-PRON- drop and fall away from -PRON- for a moment then lift -PRON-
face to -PRON- again show a deep joy in -PRON- eye as -PRON- cry out with
a heavenly enthusiasm,--"but oh shipmate on the starboard hand of
every woe there be a sure delight and high the top of that delight
than the bottom of the woe be deep be not the main truck high than
the kelson be low delight be to -PRON- a far far upward and inward
delight who against the proud god and commodore of this earth ever
stand forth -PRON- own inexorable self delight be to -PRON- whose strong
arm yet support -PRON- when the ship of this base treacherous world have
go down beneath -PRON- delight be to -PRON- who give no quarter in the
truth and kill burn and destroy all sin though -PRON- pluck -PRON- out
from under the robe of senator and judges delight top gallant
delight be to -PRON- who acknowledge no law or lord but the lord -PRON-
god and be only a patriot to heaven delight be to -PRON- whom all the
wave of the billow of the sea of the boisterous mob can never shake
from this sure keel of the ages and eternal delight and deliciousness
will be -PRON- who come to lay -PRON- down can say with -PRON- final
breath o father!--chiefly know to -PRON- by thy rod mortal or immortal
here -PRON- die -PRON- have strive to be thine more than to be this world 's or
mine own yet this be nothing -PRON- leave eternity to thee for what be man
that -PRON- should live out the lifetime of -PRON- god

-PRON- say no more but slowly wave a benediction cover -PRON- face with
-PRON- hand and so remain kneel till all the people have depart
and -PRON- be leave alone in the place



chapter 10 a bosom friend


return to the spouter inn from the chapel -PRON- find queequeg there
quite alone -PRON- have leave the chapel before the benediction some time
-PRON- be sit on a bench before the fire with -PRON- foot on the stove
hearth and in one hand be hold close up to -PRON- face that little
negro idol of -PRON- peer hard into -PRON- face and with a jack knife
gently whittle away at -PRON- nose meanwhile hum to -PRON- in -PRON-
heathenish way

but be now interrupt -PRON- put up the image and pretty soon go
to the table take up a large book there and place -PRON- on -PRON- lap
begin count the page with deliberate regularity at every fiftieth
page as -PRON- fancy stop a moment look vacantly around -PRON- and
give utterance to a long draw gurgling whistle of astonishment -PRON-
would then begin again at the next fifty seem to commence at number
one each time as though -PRON- could not count more than fifty and -PRON- be
only by such a large number of fifty be find together that -PRON-
astonishment at the multitude of page be excite

with much interest -PRON- sit watch -PRON- savage though -PRON- be and
hideously mar about the face at least to -PRON- taste -PRON- countenance
yet have a something in -PRON- which be by no mean disagreeable -PRON- can not
hide the soul through all -PRON- unearthly tattooing -PRON- think -PRON- see
the trace of a simple honest heart and in -PRON- large deep eye
fiery black and bold there seem token of a spirit that would dare a
thousand devil and besides all this there be a certain lofty bearing
about the pagan which even -PRON- uncouthness could not altogether maim
-PRON- look like a man who have never cringe and never have have a creditor
whether -PRON- be too that -PRON- head be shave -PRON- forehead be draw
out in free and bright relief and look more expansive than -PRON-
otherwise would this -PRON- will not venture to decide but certain -PRON- be
-PRON- head be phrenologically an excellent one -PRON- may seem ridiculous
but -PRON- remind -PRON- of general washington 's head as see in the popular
bust of -PRON- -PRON- have the same long regularly grade retreat slope
from above the brow which be likewise very project like two
long promontory thickly wood on top queequeg be george washington
cannibalistically develop

whilst -PRON- be thus closely scan -PRON- half pretend meanwhile to be
look out at the storm from the casement -PRON- never heed -PRON- presence
never trouble -PRON- with so much as a single glance but appear
wholly occupy with count the page of the marvellous book
consider how sociably -PRON- have be sleep together the night
previous and especially consider the affectionate arm -PRON- have find
throw over -PRON- upon wake in the morning -PRON- think this indifference
of -PRON- very strange but savage be strange being at time -PRON- do not
know exactly how to take -PRON- at first -PRON- be overawe -PRON- calm
self collectedness of simplicity seem a socratic wisdom -PRON- have notice
also that queequeg never consort at all or but very little with the
other seaman in the inn -PRON- make no advance whatever appear to have
no desire to enlarge the circle of -PRON- acquaintance all this strike
-PRON- as mighty singular yet upon second thought there be something
almost sublime in -PRON- here be a man some twenty thousand mile from
home by the way of cape horn that be which be the only way -PRON- could
get there throw among people as strange to -PRON- as though -PRON- be in
the planet jupiter and yet -PRON- seem entirely at -PRON- ease preserve
the utmost serenity content with -PRON- own companionship always equal to
-PRON- surely this be a touch of fine philosophy though no doubt -PRON-
have never hear there be such a thing as that but perhaps to be
true philosopher -PRON- mortal should not be conscious of so live or
so strive so soon as -PRON- hear that such or such a man give -PRON-
out for a philosopher -PRON- conclude that like the dyspeptic old woman -PRON-
must have break -PRON- digester

as -PRON- sit there in that now lonely room the fire burn low in that
mild stage when after -PRON- first intensity have warm the air -PRON- then
only glow to be look at the evening shade and phantom gather
round the casement and peer in upon -PRON- silent solitary twain
the storm boom without in solemn swell -PRON- begin to be sensible of
strange feeling -PRON- feel a melting in -PRON- no more -PRON- splintered heart
and maddened hand be turn against the wolfish world this soothe
savage have redeem -PRON- there -PRON- sit -PRON- very indifference speak a
nature in which there lurk no civilized hypocrisy and bland deceit
wild -PRON- be a very sight of sight to see yet -PRON- begin to feel -PRON-
mysteriously draw towards -PRON- and those same thing that would have
repel most other -PRON- be the very magnet that thus draw -PRON- -PRON- will
try a pagan friend think -PRON- since christian kindness have prove but
hollow courtesy -PRON- draw -PRON- bench near -PRON- and make some friendly sign
and hint do -PRON- good to talk with -PRON- meanwhile at first -PRON- little
notice these advance but presently upon -PRON- refer to -PRON- last
night 's hospitality -PRON- make out to ask -PRON- whether -PRON- be again to be
bedfellows -PRON- tell -PRON- yes whereat -PRON- think -PRON- look pleased perhaps
a little compliment

-PRON- then turn over the book together and -PRON- endeavor to explain to
-PRON- the purpose of the printing and the meaning of the few picture
that be in -PRON- thus -PRON- soon engage -PRON- interest and from that -PRON- go
to jabber the good -PRON- could about the various outer sight to be see
in this famous town soon -PRON- propose a social smoke and produce
-PRON- pouch and tomahawk -PRON- quietly offer -PRON- a puff and then -PRON- sit
exchange puff from that wild pipe of -PRON- and keep -PRON- regularly
pass between -PRON-

if there yet lurk any ice of indifference towards -PRON- in the pagan 's
breast this pleasant genial smoke -PRON- have soon thaw -PRON- out and leave
-PRON- crony -PRON- seem to take to -PRON- quite as naturally and unbiddenly as
-PRON- to -PRON- and when -PRON- smoke be over -PRON- press -PRON- forehead against
mine clasp -PRON- round the waist and say that henceforth -PRON- be
married mean in -PRON- country 's phrase that -PRON- be bosom friend
-PRON- would gladly die for -PRON- if need should be in a countryman this
sudden flame of friendship would have seem far too premature a thing
to be much distrust but in this simple savage those old rule would
not apply

after supper and another social chat and smoke -PRON- go to -PRON- room
together -PRON- make -PRON- a present of -PRON- embalmed head take out -PRON-
enormous tobacco wallet and grope under the tobacco draw out
some thirty dollar in silver then spread -PRON- on the table and
mechanically divide -PRON- into two equal portion push one of -PRON-
towards -PRON- and say -PRON- be mine -PRON- be go to remonstrate but -PRON-
silence -PRON- by pour -PRON- into -PRON- trowser pocket -PRON- let -PRON- stay
-PRON- then go about -PRON- evening prayer take out -PRON- idol and remove
the paper fireboard by certain sign and symptom -PRON- think -PRON- seem
anxious for -PRON- to join -PRON- but well know what be to follow -PRON-
deliberate a moment whether in case -PRON- invite -PRON- -PRON- would comply or
otherwise

-PRON- be a good christian bear and breed in the bosom of the infallible
presbyterian church how then could -PRON- unite with this wild idolator in
worship -PRON- piece of wood but what be worship think i. do
-PRON- suppose now ishmael that the magnanimous god of heaven and
earth pagan and all include can possibly be jealous of an
insignificant bit of black wood impossible but what be worship to do
the will of god that be worship and what be the will of god to do to
-PRON- fellow man what -PRON- would have -PRON- fellow man to do to -PRON- that be the
will of god now queequeg be -PRON- fellow man and what do -PRON- wish that
this queequeg would do to -PRON- why unite with -PRON- in -PRON- particular
presbyterian form of worship consequently -PRON- must then unite with -PRON-
in -PRON- ergo -PRON- must turn idolator so -PRON- kindle the shaving help
prop up the innocent little idol offer -PRON- burn biscuit with
queequeg salam before -PRON- twice or thrice kiss -PRON- nose and that
do -PRON- undress and go to bed at peace with -PRON- own conscience
and all the world but -PRON- do not go to sleep without some little chat

how -PRON- be -PRON- know not but there be no place like a bed for confidential
disclosure between friend man and wife -PRON- say there open the very
bottom of -PRON- soul to each other and some old couple often lie
and chat over old time till nearly morning thus then in -PRON- heart
honeymoon lie -PRON- and queequeg a cosy love pair



chapter 11 nightgown


-PRON- have lie thus in bed chat and nap at short interval and
queequeg now and then affectionately throw -PRON- brown tattooed leg
over mine and then draw -PRON- back so entirely sociable and free
and easy be -PRON- when at last by reason of -PRON- confabulation what
little nappishness remain in -PRON- altogether depart and -PRON- feel like
get up again though day break be yet some way down the future

yes -PRON- become very wakeful so much so that -PRON- recumbent position
begin to grow wearisome and by little and little -PRON- find -PRON-
sit up the clothe well tuck around -PRON- lean against the
head board with -PRON- four knee draw up close together and -PRON- two
nose bend over -PRON- as if -PRON- kneepan be warm pan -PRON- feel
very nice and snug the more so since -PRON- be so chilly out of door
indeed out of bed clothe too see that there be no fire in the
room the more so -PRON- say because truly to enjoy bodily warmth some
small part of -PRON- must be cold for there be no quality in this world
that be not what -PRON- be merely by contrast nothing exist in -PRON- if
-PRON- flatter -PRON- that -PRON- be all over comfortable and have be so
a long time then -PRON- can not be say to be comfortable any more but if
like queequeg and -PRON- in the bed the tip of -PRON- nose or the crown
of -PRON- head be slightly chill why then indeed in the general
consciousness -PRON- feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm for this
reason a sleep apartment should never be furnish with a fire which
be one of the luxurious discomfort of the rich for the height of this
sort of deliciousness be to have nothing but the blanket between -PRON- and
-PRON- snugness and the cold of the outer air then there -PRON- lie like the
one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal

-PRON- have be sit in this crouch manner for some time when all at
once -PRON- think -PRON- would open -PRON- eye for when between sheet whether
by day or by night and whether asleep or awake -PRON- have a way of always
keep -PRON- eye shut in order the more to concentrate the snugness
of be in bed because no man can ever feel -PRON- own identity aright
except -PRON- eye be close as if darkness be indeed the proper element
of -PRON- essence though light be more congenial to -PRON- clayey part upon
open -PRON- eye then and come out of -PRON- own pleasant and self create
darkness into the impose and coarse outer gloom of the unilluminated
twelve o'clock at night -PRON- experience a disagreeable revulsion nor do
-PRON- at all object to the hint from queequeg that perhaps -PRON- be best to
strike a light see that -PRON- be so wide awake and besides -PRON- feel
a strong desire to have a few quiet puff from -PRON- tomahawk be -PRON- say
that though -PRON- have feel such a strong repugnance to -PRON- smoking in the
bed the night before yet see how elastic -PRON- stiff prejudice grow when
love once come to bend -PRON- for now -PRON- like nothing good than to
have queequeg smoking by -PRON- even in bed because -PRON- seem to be full
of such serene household joy then -PRON- no more feel unduly concerned for
the landlord 's policy of insurance -PRON- be only alive to the condensed
confidential comfortableness of share a pipe and a blanket with a real
friend with -PRON- shaggy jacket draw about -PRON- shoulder -PRON- now pass
the tomahawk from one to the other till slowly there grow over -PRON- a
blue hang tester of smoke illuminate by the flame of the new light
lamp

whether -PRON- be that this undulating tester roll the savage away to far
distant scene -PRON- know not but -PRON- now speak of -PRON- native island and
eager to hear -PRON- history -PRON- beg -PRON- to go on and tell -PRON- -PRON- gladly
comply though at the time -PRON- but ill comprehend not a few of -PRON-
word yet subsequent disclosure when -PRON- have become more familiar with
-PRON- broken phraseology now enable -PRON- to present the whole story such as
-PRON- may prove in the mere skeleton -PRON- give



chapter 12 biographical


queequeg be a native of rokovoko an island far away to the west and
south -PRON- be not down in any map true place never be

when a new hatch savage run wild about -PRON- native woodland in
a grass clout follow by the nibble goat as if -PRON- be a green
sapling even then in queequeg 's ambitious soul lurk a strong desire
to see something more of christendom than a specimen whaler or two -PRON-
father be a high chief a king -PRON- uncle a high priest and on the
maternal side -PRON- boast aunt who be the wife of unconquerable
warrior there be excellent blood in -PRON- vein royal stuff though

passage to christian land but the ship have -PRON- full complement of
seaman spurn -PRON- suit and not all the king -PRON- father 's influence
could prevail but queequeg vow a vow alone in -PRON- canoe -PRON- paddle
off to a distant strait which -PRON- know the ship must pass through when
-PRON- quit the island on one side be a coral reef on the other a low
tongue of land cover with mangrove thicket that grow out into the
water hide -PRON- canoe still afloat among these thicket with -PRON-
prow seaward -PRON- sit down in the stern paddle low in hand and when the
ship be glide by like a flash -PRON- dart out gain -PRON- side with
one backward dash of -PRON- foot capsize and sink -PRON- canoe climb up
the chain and throw -PRON- at full length upon the deck grapple
a ring bolt there and swear not to let -PRON- go though hack in piece

in vain the captain threaten to throw -PRON- overboard suspend a
cutlass over -PRON- naked wrist queequeg be the son of a king and
queequeg budge not strike by -PRON- desperate dauntlessness and -PRON- wild
desire to visit christendom the captain at last relent and tell
-PRON- -PRON- may make -PRON- at home but this fine young savage this sea
prince of wales never see the captain 's cabin -PRON- put -PRON- down among
the sailor and make a whaleman of -PRON- but like czar peter content to
toil in the shipyard of foreign city queequeg disdain no seem
ignominy if thereby -PRON- may happily gain the power of enlighten -PRON-
untutored countryman for at bottom so -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- be actuate by a
profound desire to learn among the christians the art whereby to
make -PRON- people still happy than -PRON- be and more than that
still good than -PRON- be but alas the practice of whaleman soon
convince -PRON- that even christians could be both miserable and wicked
infinitely more so than all -PRON- father 's heathen arrive at last in
old sag harbor and see what the sailor do there and then go on
to nantucket and see how -PRON- spend -PRON- wage in that place also
poor queequeg give -PRON- up for lose thought -PRON- -PRON- be a wicked world in
all meridian -PRON- will die a pagan

and thus an old idolator at heart -PRON- yet live among these christians
wear -PRON- clothe and try to talk -PRON- gibberish hence the queer
way about -PRON- though now some time from home

by hint -PRON- ask -PRON- whether -PRON- do not propose go back and have
a coronation since -PRON- may now consider -PRON- father dead and go -PRON-
be very old and feeble at the last account -PRON- answer no not yet
and add that -PRON- be fearful christianity or rather christians have
unfit -PRON- for ascend the pure and undefiled throne of thirty pagan
king before -PRON- but by and by -PRON- say -PRON- would return as soon as
-PRON- feel -PRON- baptize again for the nonce however -PRON- propose to
sail about and sow -PRON- wild oat in all four ocean -PRON- have make a
harpooneer of -PRON- and that barbed iron be in lieu of a sceptre now

-PRON- ask -PRON- what may be -PRON- immediate purpose touch -PRON- future
movement -PRON- answer to go to sea again in -PRON- old vocation upon
this -PRON- tell -PRON- that whaling be -PRON- own design and inform -PRON- of -PRON-
intention to sail out of nantucket as be the most promising port for
an adventurous whaleman to embark from -PRON- at once resolve to accompany
-PRON- to that island ship aboard the same vessel get into the same watch
the same boat the same mess with -PRON- in short to share -PRON- every hap
with both -PRON- hand in -PRON- boldly dip into the potluck of both world
to all this -PRON- joyously assent for besides the affection -PRON- now feel
for queequeg -PRON- be an experienced harpooneer and as such could not
fail to be of great usefulness to one who like -PRON- be wholly ignorant
of the mystery of whaling though well acquaint with the sea as
know to merchant seaman

-PRON- story be end with -PRON- pipe 's last die puff queequeg embrace
-PRON- press -PRON- forehead against mine and blow out the light -PRON-
roll over from each other this way and that and very soon be
sleep

-PRON- why -PRON- carry such a troublesome thing with -PRON- ashore and
whether all whale ship do not find -PRON- own harpoon to this in
substance -PRON- reply that though what -PRON- hint be true enough yet

assure stuff well try in many a mortal combat and deeply intimate
with the heart of whale in short like many inland reaper
and mower who go into the farmer meadow armed with -PRON- own
scythe though in no wise oblige to furnish -PRON- even so queequeg

forge to melt the pitch all betoken that new cruise be on the
start that one most perilous and long voyage end only begin a
second and a second end only begin a third and so on for ever
and for aye such be the endlessness yea the intolerableness of all
earthly effort

lubber like assembly who marvel that two fellow being should be so
companionable as though a white man be anything more dignified than a
whitewash negro but there be some booby and bumpkin there who
by -PRON- intense greenness must have come from the heart and centre of
all verdure queequeg catch one of these young sapling mimic -PRON-

look -PRON- roar the captain -PRON- 'll kill e you -PRON- cannibal if -PRON-
try any more of -PRON- trick aboard here so mind -PRON- eye

but -PRON- so happen just then that -PRON- be high time for the captain to
mind -PRON- own eye the prodigious strain upon the main sail have part
the weather sheet and the tremendous boom be now fly from side to
side completely sweep the entire after part of the deck the poor
fellow whom queequeg have handle so roughly be sweep overboard all
hand be in a panic and to attempt snatch at the boom to stay -PRON-
seem madness -PRON- fly from right to left and back again almost
in one ticking of a watch and every instant seem on the point of
snap into splinter nothing be do and nothing seem capable of
be do those on deck rush towards the bow and stand eye the
boom as if -PRON- be the low jaw of an exasperated whale in the
midst of this consternation queequeg drop deftly to -PRON- knee and
crawl under the path of the boom whip hold of a rope secure one
end to the bulwark and then fling the other like a lasso catch -PRON-
round the boom as -PRON- sweep over -PRON- head and at the next jerk the spar
be that way trap and all be safe the schooner be run into the
wind and while the hand be clear away the stern boat queequeg
strip to the waist dart from the side with a long live arc of
a leap for three minute or more -PRON- be see swimming like a dog
throw -PRON- long arm straight out before -PRON- and by turn reveal
-PRON- brawny shoulder through the freeze foam -PRON- look at the grand
and glorious fellow but see no one to be save the greenhorn have go
down shoot -PRON- perpendicularly from the water queequeg now
take an instant 's glance around -PRON- and seem to see just how matter
be dive down and disappear a few minute more and -PRON- rise again
one arm still strike out and with the other drag a lifeless form
the boat soon pick -PRON- up the poor bumpkin be restore all hand
vote queequeg a noble trump the captain beg -PRON- pardon from that
hour -PRON- cleave to queequeg like a barnacle yea till poor queequeg take
-PRON- last long dive

be there ever such unconsciousness -PRON- do not seem to think that -PRON- at
all deserve a medal from the humane and magnanimous societies -PRON- only
ask for water fresh water something to wipe the brine off that
do -PRON- put on dry clothe light -PRON- pipe and lean against the
bulwark and mildly eye those around -PRON- seem to be say
to himself--"it 's a mutual joint stock world in all meridian -PRON-
cannibal must help these christians



chapter 14 nantucket


nothing more happen on the passage worthy the mentioning so after a
fine run -PRON- safely arrive in nantucket

nantucket take out -PRON- map and look at -PRON- see what a real corner of
the world -PRON- occupy how -PRON- stand there away off shore more lonely
than the eddystone lighthouse look at -PRON- a mere hillock and elbow of
sand all beach without a background there be more sand there than
-PRON- would use in twenty year as a substitute for blot paper some
gamesome wight will tell -PRON- that -PRON- have to plant weed there -PRON-
do not grow naturally that -PRON- import canada thistles that -PRON- have
to send beyond sea for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask that
piece of wood in nantucket be carry about like bit of the true
cross in rome that people there plant toadstool before -PRON- house
to get under the shade in summer time that one blade of grass make an
oasis three blade in a day 's walk a prairie that -PRON- wear quicksand
shoe something like laplander snow shoe that -PRON- be so shut up
belt about every way inclose surround and make an utter island
of by the ocean that to -PRON- very chair and table small clam will
sometimes be find adhering as to the back of sea turtle but these
extravaganza only show that nantucket be no illinois

look now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island be
settle by the red man thus go the legend in olden time an eagle
swoop down upon the new england coast and carry off an infant
indian in -PRON- talon with loud lament the parent see -PRON- child borne
out of sight over the wide water -PRON- resolve to follow in the same
direction set out in -PRON- canoe after a perilous passage -PRON-
discover the island and there -PRON- find an empty ivory casket the
poor little indian 's skeleton

what wonder then that these nantucketer bear on a beach should take
to the sea for a livelihood -PRON- first catch crab and quohog in
the sand grow bolder -PRON- wad out with net for mackerel more
experience -PRON- push off in boat and capture cod and at last
launch a navy of great ship on the sea explore this watery world
put an incessant belt of circumnavigation round -PRON- peeped in
at behring 's straits and in all season and all ocean declare
everlasting war with the mighty animate mass that have survive the
flood most monstrous and most mountainous that himmalehan salt sea
mastodon clothe with such portentousness of unconscious power that
-PRON- very panic be more to be dread than -PRON- most fearless and
malicious assault

and thus have these naked nantucketer these sea hermit issue from
-PRON- ant hill in the sea overrun and conquer the watery world like
so many alexanders parcel out among -PRON- the atlantic pacific and
indian ocean as the three pirate power do poland let america add
mexico to texas and pile cuba upon canada let the english overswarm
all india and hang out -PRON- blaze banner from the sun two third
of this terraqueous globe be the nantucketer 's for the sea be -PRON- -PRON-
own -PRON- as emperors own empire other seaman have but a right of
way through -PRON- merchant ship be but extension bridge armed one but
float fort even pirate and privateer though follow the sea
as highwaymen the road -PRON- but plunder other ship other fragment of
the land like -PRON- without seek to draw -PRON- live from the
bottomless deep -PRON- the nantucketer -PRON- alone reside and riot on
the sea -PRON- alone in bible language go down to -PRON- in ship to and
fro plough -PRON- as -PRON- own special plantation there be -PRON- home there
lie -PRON- business which a noah 's flood would not interrupt though -PRON-
overwhelm all the million in china -PRON- live on the sea as prairie
cock in the prairie -PRON- hide among the wave -PRON- climb -PRON- as
chamois hunter climb the alps for year -PRON- know not the land so
that when -PRON- come to -PRON- at last -PRON- smell like another world more
strangely than the moon would to an earthsman with the landless gull
that at sunset fold -PRON- wing and be rock to sleep between billow
so at nightfall the nantucketer out of sight of land furls -PRON- sail
and lay -PRON- to -PRON- rest while under -PRON- very pillow rush herd of
walrus and whale



chapter 15 chowder


-PRON- be quite late in the evening when the little moss come snugly
to anchor and queequeg and -PRON- go ashore so -PRON- could attend to no
business that day at least none but a supper and a bed the landlord of
the spouter inn have recommend -PRON- to -PRON- cousin hosea hussey of the
try pot whom -PRON- assert to be the proprietor of one of the good keep
hotel in all nantucket and moreover -PRON- have assure -PRON- that cousin
hosea as -PRON- call -PRON- be famous for -PRON- chowder in short -PRON-
plainly hint that -PRON- could not possibly do good than try pot luck at
the try pot but the direction -PRON- have give -PRON- about keep a yellow
warehouse on -PRON- starboard hand till -PRON- open a white church to the
larboard and then keep that on the larboard hand till -PRON- make a
corner three point to the starboard and that do then ask the first
man -PRON- meet where the place be these crooked direction of -PRON- very
much puzzle -PRON- at first especially as at the outset queequeg
insist that the yellow warehouse -PRON- first point of departure must
be leave on the larboard hand whereas -PRON- have understand peter coffin to
say -PRON- be on the starboard however by dint of beat about a little
in the dark and now and then knock up a peaceable inhabitant
to inquire the way -PRON- at last come to something which there be no
mistake

two enormous wooden pot paint black and suspend by ass ear
swung from the cross tree of an old top mast plant in front of an
old doorway the horn of the cross tree be saw off on the other
side so that this old top mast look not a little like a gallow
perhaps -PRON- be over sensitive to such impression at the time but -PRON-
could not help star at this gallow with a vague misgiving a sort of
crick be in -PRON- neck as -PRON- gaze up to the two remain horn yes two
of -PRON- one for queequeg and one for -PRON- -PRON- be ominous think i. a
coffin -PRON- innkeeper upon landing in -PRON- first whaling port tombstone
star at -PRON- in the whaleman 's chapel and here a gallow and a pair
of prodigious black pot too be these last throw out oblique hint
touch tophet

-PRON- be call from these reflection by the sight of a freckled woman
with yellow hair and a yellow gown stand in the porch of the inn
under a dull red lamp swing there that look much like an injure
eye and carry on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen
shirt

get along with ye say -PRON- to the man or -PRON- will be comb ye

come on queequeg say -PRON- all right there be mrs. hussey

and so -PRON- turn out mr. hosea hussey be from home but leave
mrs. hussey entirely competent to attend to all -PRON- affair upon
make know -PRON- desire for a supper and a bed mrs. hussey postpone
further scolding for the present usher -PRON- into a little room and
seat -PRON- at a table spread with the relic of a recently conclude
repast turn round to -PRON- and said--"clam or cod

what be that about cods ma'am say -PRON- with much politeness

clam or cod -PRON- repeat

a clam for supper a cold clam be that what -PRON- mean mrs. hussey
say -PRON- but that be a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter
time be not -PRON- mrs. hussey

but be in a great hurry to resume scold the man in the purple
shirt who be wait for -PRON- in the entry and seem to hear nothing
but the word clam mrs. hussey hurry towards an open door lead to
the kitchen and bawl out clam for two disappear

queequeg say -PRON- do -PRON- think that -PRON- can make out a supper for -PRON-
both on one clam

however a warm savory steam from the kitchen serve to belie the
apparently cheerless prospect before -PRON- but when that smoking chowder
come in the mystery be delightfully explain oh sweet friend
hearken to -PRON- -PRON- be make of small juicy clam scarcely big than
hazel nut mix with pound ship biscuit and salt pork cut up into
little flake the whole enriched with butter and plentifully seasoned
with pepper and salt -PRON- appetite be sharpen by the frosty
voyage and in particular queequeg see -PRON- favourite fishing food
before -PRON- and the chowder be surpassingly excellent -PRON- despatch
-PRON- with great expedition when lean back a moment and bethink
-PRON- of mrs. hussey 's clam and cod announcement -PRON- think -PRON- would try
a little experiment step to the kitchen door -PRON- utter the word
cod with great emphasis and resume -PRON- seat in a few moment the
savoury steam come forth again but with a different flavor and in good
time a fine cod chowder be place before -PRON-

-PRON- resume business and while ply -PRON- spoon in the bowl think -PRON-
to -PRON- -PRON- wonder now if this here have any effect on the head
what be that stultify say about chowder head people but look
queequeg be not that a live eel in -PRON- bowl where be -PRON- harpoon

fishiest of all fishy place be the try pot which well deserve
-PRON- name for the pot there be always boil chowder chowder for
breakfast and chowder for dinner and chowder for supper till -PRON-
begin to look for fish bone come through -PRON- clothe the area
before the house be pave with clam shell mrs. hussey wear a polished
necklace of codfish vertebra and hosea hussey have -PRON- account book
bind in superior old shark skin there be a fishy flavor to the milk
too which -PRON- could not at all account for till one morning happen
to take a stroll along the beach among some fisherman 's boat -PRON- see
hosea 's brindled cow feed on fish remnant and march along the
sand with each foot in a cod 's decapitate head look very slip shod
-PRON- assure ye

supper conclude -PRON- receive a lamp and direction from mrs. hussey
concern the near way to bed but as queequeg be about to precede
-PRON- up the stair the lady reach forth -PRON- arm and demand -PRON-
harpoon -PRON- allow no harpoon in -PRON- chamber why not say -PRON-
every true whaleman sleep with -PRON- harpoon but why not because
-PRON- be dangerous say -PRON- ever since young stiggs come from that
unfort'nt v'y'ge of -PRON- when -PRON- be go four year and a half with
only three barrel of ile be find dead in -PRON- first floor back with
-PRON- harpoon in -PRON- side ever since then -PRON- allow no boarder to take
sich dangerous weepon in -PRON- room at night so mr. queequeg for
-PRON- have learn -PRON- name -PRON- will just take this here iron and keep
-PRON- for -PRON- till morning but the chowder clam or cod to morrow for
breakfast man

both say -PRON- and let 's have a couple of smoke herring by way of
variety



chapter 16 the ship


in bed -PRON- concoct -PRON- plan for the morrow but to -PRON- surprise and
no small concern queequeg now give -PRON- to understand that -PRON- have be
diligently consult yojo the name of -PRON- black little god and yojo
have tell -PRON- two or three time over and strongly insist upon -PRON-
everyway that instead of -PRON- go together among the whaling fleet in
harbor and in concert select -PRON- craft instead of this -PRON- say yojo
earnestly enjoin that the selection of the ship should rest wholly
with -PRON- inasmuch as yojo purpose befriend -PRON- and in order to
do so have already pitch upon a vessel which if leave to -PRON- -PRON-
ishmael should infallibly light upon for all the world as though -PRON-
have turn out by chance and in that vessel -PRON- must immediately ship
-PRON- for the present irrespective of queequeg

-PRON- have forget to mention that in many thing queequeg place great
confidence in the excellence of yojo 's judgment and surprising forecast
of thing and cherish yojo with considerable esteem as a rather good
sort of god who perhaps mean well enough upon the whole but in all
case do not succeed in -PRON- benevolent design

now this plan of queequeg 's or rather yojo 's touch the selection
of -PRON- craft -PRON- do not like that plan at all -PRON- have not a little relied
upon queequeg 's sagacity to point out the whaler best fit to carry
-PRON- and -PRON- fortune securely but as all -PRON- remonstrance produce
no effect upon queequeg -PRON- be oblige to acquiesce and accordingly
prepared to set about this business with a determine rush sort
of energy and vigor that should quickly settle that trifling little
affair next morning early leave queequeg shut up with yojo in -PRON-
little bedroom for -PRON- seem that -PRON- be some sort of lent or ramadan
or day of fasting humiliation and prayer with queequeg and yojo that
day how -PRON- be -PRON- never could find out for though -PRON- apply -PRON-
to -PRON- several time -PRON- never could master -PRON- liturgy and xxxix
article leave queequeg then fast on -PRON- tomahawk pipe and yojo
warm -PRON- at -PRON- sacrificial fire of shaving -PRON- sally out among
the shipping after much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiry
-PRON- learn that there be three ship up for three year voyage the
devil dam the tit bit and the pequod devil dam -PRON- do not know the
origin of tit bit be obvious pequod -PRON- will no doubt remember be
the name of a celebrated tribe of massachusetts indians now extinct
as the ancient medes -PRON- peer and pry about the devil dam from -PRON-
hop over to the tit bit and finally go on board the pequod
look around -PRON- for a moment and then decide that this be the very
ship for -PRON-

-PRON- may have see many a quaint craft in -PRON- day for aught -PRON-
know square toed lugger mountainous japanese junk butter box
galliot and what not but take -PRON- word for -PRON- -PRON- never see such a
rare old craft as this same rare old pequod -PRON- be a ship of the old
school rather small if anything with an old fashioned claw foot look
about -PRON- long seasoned and weather stain in the typhoon and calm
of all four ocean -PRON- old hull 's complexion be darken like a french
grenadier 's who have alike fight in egypt and siberia -PRON- venerable
bow look bearded -PRON- mast cut somewhere on the coast of japan
where -PRON- original one be lose overboard in a gale -PRON- mast stand
stiffly up like the spine of the three old king of cologne -PRON-
ancient deck be wear and wrinkle like the pilgrim worship
flag stone in canterbury cathedral where becket bleed but to all these
-PRON- old antiquity be add new and marvellous feature pertain
to the wild business that for more than half a century -PRON- have follow
old captain peleg many year -PRON- chief mate before -PRON- command
another vessel of -PRON- own and now a retired seaman and one of the
principal owner of the pequod this old peleg during the term of -PRON-
chief mateship have build upon -PRON- original grotesqueness and inlay
-PRON- all over with a quaintness both of material and device unmatched
by anything except -PRON- be thorkill hake 's carve buckler or bedstead -PRON-
be apparell like any barbaric ethiopian emperor -PRON- neck heavy with
pendant of polished ivory -PRON- be a thing of trophy a cannibal of
a craft trick -PRON- forth in the chase bone of -PRON- enemy all
round -PRON- unpanelled open bulwark be garnish like one continuous
jaw with the long sharp tooth of the sperm whale insert there for
pin to fasten -PRON- old hempen thews and tendon to those thew run not
through base block of land wood but deftly travel over sheaf of
sea ivory scorn a turnstile wheel at -PRON- reverend helm -PRON- sport
there a tiller and that tiller be in one mass curiously carve
from the long narrow lower jaw of -PRON- hereditary foe the helmsman who
steer by that tiller in a tempest feel like the tartar when -PRON- hold
back -PRON- fiery steed by clutch -PRON- jaw a noble craft but somehow a
most melancholy all noble thing be touch with that

now when -PRON- look about the quarter deck for some one have authority
in order to propose -PRON- as a candidate for the voyage at first -PRON- see
nobody but -PRON- could not well overlook a strange sort of tent or
rather wigwam pitch a little behind the main mast -PRON- seem only
a temporary erection use in port -PRON- be of a conical shape some ten
foot high consist of the long huge slab of limber black bone take
from the middle and high part of the jaws of the right whale
plant with -PRON- broad end on the deck a circle of these slab lace
together mutually sloped towards each other and at the apex unite in
a tufted point where the loose hairy fibre wave to and fro like the
top knot on some old pottowottamie sachem 's head a triangular opening
face towards the bow of the ship so that the insider command a
complete view forward

and half conceal in this queer tenement -PRON- at length find one who
by -PRON- aspect seem to have authority and who -PRON- be noon and
the ship 's work suspend be now enjoy respite from the burden of
command -PRON- be seat on an old fashioned oaken chair wriggle all
over with curious carving and the bottom of which be form of a
stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam be
construct

there be nothing so very particular perhaps about the appearance of
the elderly man -PRON- see -PRON- be brown and brawny like most old seaman
and heavily roll up in blue pilot cloth cut in the quaker style
only there be a fine and almost microscopic net work of the minute
wrinkle interlace round -PRON- eye which must have arise from
-PRON- continual sailing in many hard gale and always look to
windward for this cause the muscle about the eye to become pursed
together such eye wrinkle be very effectual in a scowl

be this the captain of the pequod say -PRON- advance to the door of
the tent

suppose -PRON- be the captain of the pequod what dost thou want of -PRON-
-PRON- demand

-PRON- be think of shipping

thou wast wast thou -PRON- see thou art no nantucketer ever be in a
stove boat

no sir -PRON- never have

dost know nothing at all about whaling -PRON- dare say eh

nothing sir but -PRON- have no doubt -PRON- shall soon learn -PRON- have be several
voyage in the merchant service and -PRON- think that--

merchant service be damn talk not that lingo to -PRON- dost see that
leg i'll take that leg away from thy stern if ever thou talk of
the marchant service to -PRON- again marchant service indeed -PRON- suppose now
ye feel considerable proud of have serve in those marchant ship
but fluke man what make thee want to go a whaling eh -PRON- look
a little suspicious do not -PRON- eh hast not be a pirate hast
thou didst not rob thy last captain didst thou dost not think of
murder the officer when thou gettest to sea

-PRON- protest -PRON- innocence of these thing -PRON- see that under the mask
of these half humorous innuendo this old seaman as an insulate
quakerish nantucketer be full of -PRON- insular prejudice and rather
distrustful of all alien unless -PRON- hail from cape cod or the
vineyard

but what take thee a whaling -PRON- want to know that before -PRON- think of
shipping ye

well sir -PRON- want to see what whaling be -PRON- want to see the world

want to see what whaling be eh have ye clap eye on captain ahab

who be captain ahab sir

aye aye -PRON- think so captain ahab be the captain of this ship

-PRON- be mistake then -PRON- think -PRON- be speak to the captain -PRON-

thou art speak to captain peleg that be who ye be speak to
young man -PRON- belong to -PRON- and captain bildad to see the pequod fit
out for the voyage and supply with all -PRON- need include crew -PRON-
be part owner and agent but as -PRON- be go to say if thou want
to know what whaling be as thou tell ye do -PRON- can put ye in a way of
find -PRON- out before ye bind -PRON- to -PRON- past back out clap
eye on captain ahab young man and thou wilt find that -PRON- have only one
leg

what do -PRON- mean sir be the other one lose by a whale

lose by a whale young man come nearer to -PRON- -PRON- be devour
chew up crunch by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chip a
boat!--ah ah

-PRON- be a little alarmed by -PRON- energy perhaps also a little touch at
the hearty grief in -PRON- concluding exclamation but say as calmly as -PRON-
could what -PRON- say be no doubt true enough sir but how could -PRON- know
there be any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale though indeed
-PRON- may have infer as much from the simple fact of the accident

look ye now young man thy lung be a sort of soft d'ye see thou
dost not talk shark a bit sure ye've be to sea before now sure of
that

sir say -PRON- -PRON- think -PRON- tell -PRON- that -PRON- have be four voyage in the
merchant--

hard down out of that mind what -PRON- say about the marchant
service don't aggravate -PRON- -PRON- will not have -PRON- but let -PRON- understand each
other -PRON- have give thee a hint about what whaling be do ye yet feel
inclined for -PRON-

-PRON- do sir

very good now art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live whale 's
throat and then jump after -PRON- answer quick

-PRON- be sir if -PRON- should be positively indispensable to do so not to be
get rid of that be which -PRON- do not take to be the fact

good again now then thou not only want to go a whaling to find
out by experience what whaling be but ye also want to go in order to
see the world be not that what ye say -PRON- think so well then just
step forward there and take a peep over the weather bow and then back
to -PRON- and tell -PRON- what ye see there

for a moment -PRON- stand a little puzzle by this curious request not
know exactly how to take -PRON- whether humorously or in earnest but
concentrate all -PRON- crow 's foot into one scowl captain peleg start
-PRON- on the errand

go forward and glance over the weather bow -PRON- perceive that the
ship swing to -PRON- anchor with the flood tide be now obliquely
point towards the open ocean the prospect be unlimited but
exceedingly monotonous and forbidding not the slight variety that -PRON-
could see

well what be the report say peleg when -PRON- come back what do ye
see

not much -PRON- replied--"noth but water considerable horizon though
and there be a squall come up -PRON- think

well what do thou think then of see the world do ye wish to go
round cape horn to see any more of -PRON- eh can not ye see the world where
-PRON- stand

-PRON- be a little staggered but go a whaling -PRON- must and -PRON- would and the
pequod be as good a ship as any -PRON- think the good and all this -PRON- now
repeat to peleg see -PRON- so determined -PRON- express -PRON- willingness
to ship -PRON-

and thou may as well sign the paper right off -PRON- added--"come
along with ye and so say -PRON- lead the way below deck into the cabin

seat on the transom be what seem to -PRON- a most uncommon and
surprising figure -PRON- turn out to be captain bildad who along with
captain peleg be one of the large owner of the vessel the other
share as be sometimes the case in these port be hold by a crowd
of old annuitant widow fatherless child and chancery ward each
own about the value of a timber head or a foot of plank or a nail
or two in the ship people in nantucket invest -PRON- money in whale
vessel the same way that -PRON- do -PRON- in approve state stock
bring in good interest

now bildad like peleg and indeed many other nantucketers be a
quaker the island have be originally settle by that sect and to
this day -PRON- inhabitant in general retain in an uncommon measure the
peculiarity of the quaker only variously and anomalously modify
by thing altogether alien and heterogeneous for some of these same
quaker be the most sanguinary of all sailor and whale hunter -PRON-
be fight quakers -PRON- be quakers with a vengeance

so that there be instance among -PRON- of man who name with scripture
name a singularly common fashion on the island and in childhood
naturally imbibe the stately dramatic thee and thou of the quaker
idiom still from the audacious daring and boundless adventure
of -PRON- subsequent life strangely blend with these unoutgrown
peculiarity a thousand bold dash of character not unworthy a
scandinavian sea king or a poetical pagan roman and when these thing
unite in a man of greatly superior natural force with a globular brain
and a ponderous heart who have also by the stillness and seclusion
of many long night watch in the remotest water and beneath
constellation never see here at the north be lead to think
untraditionally and independently receive all nature 's sweet or
savage impression fresh from -PRON- own virgin voluntary and confide
breast and thereby chiefly but with some help from accidental
advantage to learn a bold and nervous lofty language that man make
one in a whole nation 's census a mighty pageant creature form for
noble tragedy nor will -PRON- at all detract from -PRON- dramatically
regard if either by birth or other circumstance -PRON- have what seem
a half wilful overrule morbidness at the bottom of -PRON- nature for all
man tragically great be make so through a certain morbidness be sure
of this o young ambition all mortal greatness be but disease but
as yet -PRON- have not to do with such an one but with quite another and
still a man who if indeed peculiar -PRON- only result again from another
phase of the quaker modify by individual circumstance

like captain peleg captain bildad be a well to do retired whaleman
but unlike captain peleg who care not a rush for what be call
serious thing and indeed deemed those self same serious thing the
veriest of all trifle captain bildad have not only be originally
educate accord to the strictest sect of nantucket quakerism but all
-PRON- subsequent ocean life and the sight of many unclad lovely island
creature round the horn all that have not move this native bear
quaker one single jot have not so much as alter one angle of -PRON-
vest still for all this immutableness be there some lack of
common consistency about worthy captain peleg though refuse from
conscientious scruple to bear arm against land invader yet -PRON-
have illimitably invade the atlantic and pacific and though a swear foe
to human bloodshed yet have -PRON- in -PRON- straight bodied coat spill tun
upon tun of leviathan gore how now in the contemplative evening of -PRON-
day the pious bildad reconcile these thing in the reminiscence -PRON- do
not know but -PRON- do not seem to concern -PRON- much and very probably
-PRON- have long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man 's
religion be one thing and this practical world quite another this
world pay dividend rise from a little cabin boy in short clothe
of the drab drab to a harpooneer in a broad shad belly waistcoat
from that become boat header chief mate and captain and finally a
ship owner bildad as -PRON- hint before have conclude -PRON- adventurous
career by wholly retire from active life at the goodly age of
sixty and dedicate -PRON- remain day to the quiet receiving of -PRON-
well earn income

now bildad -PRON- be sorry to say have the reputation of be an
incorrigible old hunk and in -PRON- sea go day a bitter hard
task master -PRON- tell -PRON- in nantucket though -PRON- certainly seem a
curious story that when -PRON- sail the old categut whaleman -PRON- crew
upon arrive home be mostly all carry ashore to the hospital sore
exhausted and wear out for a pious man especially for a quaker -PRON- be
certainly rather hard heart to say the least -PRON- never use to swear
though at -PRON- man -PRON- say but somehow -PRON- get an inordinate
quantity of cruel unmitigated hard work out of -PRON- when bildad be a
chief mate to have -PRON- drab coloured eye intently look at -PRON- make
-PRON- feel completely nervous till -PRON- could clutch something a hammer
or a marling spike and go to work like mad at something or other
never mind what indolence and idleness perish before -PRON- -PRON- own
person be the exact embodiment of -PRON- utilitarian character on -PRON-
long gaunt body -PRON- carry no spare flesh no superfluous beard
-PRON- chin have a soft economical nap to -PRON- like the worn nap of -PRON-
broad brimmed hat

such then be the person that -PRON- see seat on the transom when -PRON-
follow captain peleg down into the cabin the space between the deck
be small and there bolt upright sit old bildad who always sit so
and never lean and this to save -PRON- coat tail -PRON- broad brim be
place beside -PRON- -PRON- leg be stiffly cross -PRON- drab vesture be
button up to -PRON- chin and spectacle on nose -PRON- seem absorb in
read from a ponderous volume

bildad cry captain peleg at -PRON- again bildad eh ye have be
study those scripture now for the last thirty year to -PRON- certain
knowledge how far ye get bildad

as if long habituate to such profane talk from -PRON- old shipmate
bildad without notice -PRON- present irreverence quietly look up and
see -PRON- glance again inquiringly towards peleg

-PRON- say -PRON- be -PRON- man bildad say peleg -PRON- want to ship

dost thee say bildad in a hollow tone and turn round to -PRON-

-PRON- dost say -PRON- unconsciously -PRON- be so intense a quaker

what do ye think of -PRON- bildad say peleg

-PRON- 'll do say bildad eye -PRON- and then go on spell away at
-PRON- book in a mumble tone quite audible

-PRON- think -PRON- the queer old quaker -PRON- ever see especially as peleg
-PRON- friend and old shipmate seem such a blusterer but -PRON- say
nothing only look round -PRON- sharply peleg now throw open a chest
and draw forth the ship 's article place pen and ink before -PRON-
and seat -PRON- at a little table -PRON- begin to think -PRON- be high time
to settle with -PRON- at what term -PRON- would be willing to engage for the
voyage -PRON- be already aware that in the whaling business -PRON- pay no
wage but all hand include the captain receive certain share of
the profit call lay and that these lay be proportion to the
degree of importance pertain to the respective duty of the ship 's
company -PRON- be also aware that be a green hand at whaling -PRON- own
lay would not be very large but consider that -PRON- be use to the sea
could steer a ship splice a rope and all that -PRON- make no doubt that
from all -PRON- have hear -PRON- should be offer at least the 275th lie that
be the 275th part of the clear net proceed of the voyage whatev
that may eventually amount to and though the 275th lie be what -PRON-
call a rather long lay yet -PRON- be good than nothing and if -PRON- have a
lucky voyage may pretty nearly pay for the clothing -PRON- would wear out
on -PRON- not to speak of -PRON- three year beef and board for which -PRON- would
not have to pay one stiver

-PRON- may be think that this be a poor way to accumulate a princely
fortune and so -PRON- be a very poor way indeed but -PRON- be one of those
that never take on about princely fortune and be quite content if the
world be ready to board and lodge -PRON- while -PRON- be put up at this grim
sign of the thunder cloud upon the whole -PRON- think that the 275th lie
would be about the fair thing but would not have be surprised have -PRON-
be offer the 200th consider -PRON- be of a broad shoulder make

but one thing nevertheless that make -PRON- a little distrustful about
receive a generous share of the profit be this ashore -PRON- have hear
something of both captain peleg and -PRON- unaccountable old crony bildad
how that -PRON- be the principal proprietor of the pequod therefore
the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owner leave nearly the
whole management of the ship 's affair to these two and -PRON- do not know
but what the stingy old bildad may have a mighty deal to say about
ship hand especially as -PRON- now find -PRON- on board the pequod
quite at home there in the cabin and read -PRON- bible as if at -PRON-
own fireside now while peleg be vainly try to mend a pen with -PRON-
jack knife old bildad to -PRON- no small surprise consider that -PRON- be
such an interested party in these proceeding bildad never heed
-PRON- but go on mumble to -PRON- out of -PRON- book lay not up for
yourself treasure upon earth where moth--

well captain bildad interrupt peleg what d'ye say what lie
shall -PRON- give this young man

thou knowest good be the sepulchral reply the seven hundred and
seventy seventh would not be too much would it?--'where moth and rust do
corrupt but lay--

lay indeed think -PRON- and such a lay the seven hundred and
seventy seventh well old bildad -PRON- be determined that -PRON- for one
shall not lay up many lays here below where moth and rust do corrupt
-PRON- be an exceedingly long lay that indeed and though from the
magnitude of the figure -PRON- may at first deceive a landsman yet
the slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and
seventy seven be a pretty large number yet when -PRON- come to make
a teenth of -PRON- -PRON- will then see -PRON- say that the seven hundred and
seventy seventh part of a farthing be a good deal less than seven
hundred and seventy seven gold doubloon and so -PRON- think at the time

why blast -PRON- eye bildad cry peleg thou dost not want to
swindle this young man -PRON- must have more than that

seven hundred and seventy seventh again say bildad without lift
-PRON- eye and then go on mumbling--"for where -PRON- treasure be there
will -PRON- heart be also

-PRON- be go to put -PRON- down for the three hundredth say peleg do ye
hear that bildad the three hundredth lie -PRON- say

bildad lay down -PRON- book and turn solemnly towards -PRON- say
captain peleg thou hast a generous heart but thou must consider the
duty thou owest to the other owner of this ship widow and orphan
many of -PRON- and that if -PRON- too abundantly reward the labor of this
young man -PRON- may be take the bread from those widow and those
orphan the seven hundred and seventy seventh lay captain peleg

thou bildad roar peleg start up and clatter about the
cabin blast ye captain bildad if -PRON- have follow thy advice in these
matter -PRON- would afore now have a conscience to lug about that would be
heavy enough to founder the large ship that ever sail round cape
horn

captain peleg say bildad steadily thy conscience may be draw
ten inch of water or ten fathom -PRON- can not tell but as thou art still
an impenitent man captain peleg -PRON- greatly fear l thy conscience be
but a leaky one and will in the end sink thee founder down to the
fiery pit captain peleg

fiery pit fiery pit ye insult -PRON- man past all natural bearing ye
insult -PRON- -PRON- be an all fire outrage to tell any human creature that
-PRON- be bind to hell fluke and flame bildad say that again to -PRON- and
start -PRON- soul bolt but i'll i'll yes -PRON- will swallow a live goat with
all -PRON- hair and horn on out of the cabin ye cant drab coloured
son of a wooden gun a straight wake with ye

as -PRON- thunder out this -PRON- make a rush at bildad but with a marvellous
oblique slide celerity bildad for that time elude -PRON-

alarm at this terrible outburst between the two principal and
responsible owner of the ship and feel half a mind to give up
all idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably own and temporarily
command -PRON- step aside from the door to give egress to bildad who
-PRON- make no doubt be all eagerness to vanish from before the awaken
wrath of peleg but to -PRON- astonishment -PRON- sit down again on the
transom very quietly and seem to have not the slight intention of
withdraw -PRON- seem quite used to impenitent peleg and -PRON- way as
for peleg after let off -PRON- rage as -PRON- have there seem no more
leave in -PRON- and -PRON- too sit down like a lamb though -PRON- twitch a
little as if still nervously agitated whew -PRON- whistle at last--"the
squall 's go off to leeward -PRON- think bildad thou use to be good at
sharpen a lance mend that pen will ye -PRON- jack knife here need
the grindstone that be -PRON- thank ye bildad now then -PRON- young man
ishmael 's thy name do not ye say well then down ye go here ishmael
for the three hundredth lie

captain peleg say -PRON- -PRON- have a friend with -PRON- who want to ship
too shall -PRON- bring -PRON- down to morrow

to be sure say peleg fetch -PRON- along and -PRON- will look at -PRON-

what lay do -PRON- want groan bildad glance up from the book in
which -PRON- have again be bury -PRON-

oh never thee mind about that bildad say peleg have -PRON- ever
whale -PRON- any turn to -PRON-

kill more whale than -PRON- can count captain peleg

well bring -PRON- along then

and after sign the paper off -PRON- go nothing doubt but that -PRON-
have do a good morning 's work and that the pequod be the identical
ship that yojo have provide to carry queequeg and -PRON- round the cape

but -PRON- have not proceed far when -PRON- begin to bethink -PRON- that the captain
with whom -PRON- be to sail yet remain unseen by -PRON- though indeed in
many case a whale ship will be completely fit out and receive all
-PRON- crew on board ere the captain make -PRON- visible by arrive
to take command for sometimes these voyage be so prolonged and the
shore interval at home so exceedingly brief that if the captain have
a family or any absorb concernment of that sort -PRON- do not trouble
-PRON- much about -PRON- ship in port but leave -PRON- to the owner till
all is ready for sea however -PRON- be always as well to have a look at
-PRON- before irrevocably commit -PRON- into -PRON- hand turn back
-PRON- accost captain peleg inquire where captain ahab be to be find

and what dost thou want of captain ahab -PRON- be all right enough thou
art ship

yes but -PRON- should like to see -PRON-

but -PRON- do not think thou wilt be able to at present -PRON- do not know exactly
what be the matter with -PRON- but -PRON- keep close inside the house a sort
of sick and yet -PRON- do not look so in fact -PRON- be not sick but no -PRON-
be not well either any how young man -PRON- will not always see -PRON- so -PRON-
do not suppose -PRON- will thee -PRON- be a queer man captain ahab so some
think but a good one oh thou'lt like -PRON- well enough no fear no
fear -PRON- be a grand ungodly god like man captain ahab do not speak
much but when -PRON- do speak then -PRON- may well listen mark ye be
forewarn ahab 's above the common ahab 's be in college as well as
mong the cannibal be use to deep wonder than the wave fix
-PRON- fiery lance in mightier stranger foe than whale -PRON- lance
aye the keen and the sure that out of all -PRON- isle oh -PRON- be not
captain bildad no and -PRON- be not captain peleg he 's ahab boy and ahab
of old thou know be a crown king

and a very vile one when that wicked king be slay the dog do
-PRON- not lick -PRON- blood

come hither to -PRON- hither hither say peleg with a significance in
-PRON- eye that almost startle -PRON- look ye lad never say that on board
the pequod never say -PRON- anywhere captain ahab do not name -PRON-
twas a foolish ignorant whim of -PRON- crazy widowed mother who die
when -PRON- be only a twelvemonth old and yet the old squaw tistig at
gayhead say that the name would somehow prove prophetic and perhaps
other fool like -PRON- may tell thee the same -PRON- wish to warn thee -PRON- be a
lie -PRON- know captain ahab well -PRON- have sail with -PRON- as mate year ago
-PRON- know what -PRON- be a good man not a pious good man like bildad but
a swear good man something like -PRON- only there be a good deal more of
-PRON- aye aye -PRON- know that -PRON- be never very jolly and -PRON- know that on
the passage home -PRON- be a little out of -PRON- mind for a spell but -PRON-
be the sharp shooting pain in -PRON- bleeding stump that bring that
about as any one may see -PRON- know too that ever since -PRON- lose
-PRON- leg last voyage by that accursed whale -PRON- be be a kind of
moody desperate moody and savage sometimes but that will all pass
off and once for all let -PRON- tell thee and assure thee young man -PRON- be
good to sail with a moody good captain than a laugh bad one so
good bye to thee and wrong not captain ahab because -PRON- happen to
have a wicked name besides -PRON- boy -PRON- have a wife not three voyage
wedded a sweet resigned girl think of that by that sweet girl that
old man have a child hold ye then there can be any utter hopeless
harm in ahab no no -PRON- lad stricken blast if -PRON- be ahab have -PRON-
humanity

as -PRON- walk away -PRON- be full of thoughtfulness what have be
incidentally reveal to -PRON- of captain ahab fill -PRON- with a certain
wild vagueness of painfulness concern -PRON- and somehow at the time
-PRON- feel a sympathy and a sorrow for -PRON- but for -PRON- do not know what
unless -PRON- be the cruel loss of -PRON- leg and yet -PRON- also feel a strange
awe of -PRON- but that sort of awe which -PRON- can not at all describe be
not exactly awe -PRON- do not know what -PRON- be but -PRON- feel -PRON- and -PRON- do
not disincline -PRON- towards -PRON- though -PRON- feel impatience at what seem
like mystery in -PRON- so imperfectly as -PRON- be know to -PRON- then however
-PRON- thought be at length carry in other direction so that for the
present dark ahab slip -PRON- mind



chapter 17 the ramadan


as queequeg 's ramadan or fasting and humiliation be to continue all
day -PRON- do not choose to disturb -PRON- till towards night fall for -PRON-
cherish the great respect towards everybody 's religious obligation
never mind how comical and could not find -PRON- in -PRON- heart to undervalue
even a congregation of ant worship a toad stool or those other
creature in certain part of -PRON- earth who with a degree of footmanism
quite unprecedented in other planet bow down before the torso of
a deceased land proprietor merely on account of the inordinate
possession yet own and rent in -PRON- name

-PRON- say -PRON- good presbyterian christians should be charitable in these
thing and not fancy -PRON- so vastly superior to other mortal
pagan and what not because of -PRON- half crazy conceit on these
subject there be queequeg now certainly entertain the most
absurd notion about yojo and -PRON- ramadan but what of that queequeg
think -PRON- know what -PRON- be about -PRON- suppose -PRON- seem to be content
and there let -PRON- rest all -PRON- arguing with -PRON- would not avail let
-PRON- be -PRON- say and heaven have mercy on -PRON- all presbyterians and pagans
alike for -PRON- be all somehow dreadfully crack about the head and
sadly ne mend

towards evening when -PRON- feel assure that all -PRON- performance and
ritual must be over -PRON- go up to -PRON- room and knock at the door but
no answer -PRON- try to open -PRON- but -PRON- be fasten inside queequeg
say -PRON- softly through the key hole all silent -PRON- say queequeg why
do not -PRON- speak -PRON- be -PRON- ishmael but all remain still as before -PRON-
begin to grow alarmed -PRON- have allow -PRON- such abundant time -PRON- think
-PRON- may have have an apoplectic fit -PRON- look through the key hole but
the door open into an odd corner of the room the key hole prospect
be but a crooked and sinister one -PRON- could only see part of the
foot board of the bed and a line of the wall but nothing more -PRON-
be surprised to behold rest against the wall the wooden shaft of
queequeg 's harpoon which the landlady the evening previous have take
from -PRON- before -PRON- mount to the chamber that be strange think -PRON-
but at any rate since the harpoon stand yonder and -PRON- seldom or
never go abroad without -PRON- therefore -PRON- must be inside here and no
possible mistake

queequeg!--queequeg!"--all still something must have happen
apoplexy -PRON- try to burst open the door but -PRON- stubbornly resist
run down stair -PRON- quickly state -PRON- suspicion to the first person
-PRON- meet the chamber maid la la -PRON- cry -PRON- think something must
be the matter -PRON- go to make the bed after breakfast and the door be
lock and not a mouse to be hear and -PRON- be be just so silent ever
since but -PRON- think may be -PRON- have both go off and lock -PRON-
baggage in for safe keeping la la ma'am!--mistress murder mrs.
hussey apoplexy!"--and with these cry -PRON- run towards the kitchen -PRON-
follow

mrs. hussey soon appear with a mustard pot in one hand and a
vinegar cruet in the other have just break away from the occupation
of attend to the castor and scold -PRON- little black boy meantime

wood house cry -PRON- which way to -PRON- run for god 's sake and fetch
something to pry open the door the axe!--the axe -PRON- be have a stroke
depend upon it!"--and so say -PRON- be unmethodically rush up stair
again empty handed when mrs. hussey interpose the mustard pot and
vinegar cruet and the entire castor of -PRON- countenance

what be the matter with -PRON- young man

get the axe for god 's sake run for the doctor some one while -PRON- pry
-PRON- open

look here say the landlady quickly put down the vinegar cruet
so as to have one hand free look here be -PRON- talk about pry
open any of -PRON- door and with that -PRON- seize -PRON- arm what be the
matter with -PRON- what be the matter with -PRON- shipmate

in as calm but rapid a manner as possible -PRON- give -PRON- to understand the
whole case unconsciously clap the vinegar cruet to one side of -PRON-
nose -PRON- ruminate for an instant then exclaimed--"no -PRON- haven't see
-PRON- since -PRON- put -PRON- there run to a little closet under the landing
of the stair -PRON- glance in and return tell -PRON- that queequeg 's
harpoon be miss -PRON- be kill -PRON- -PRON- cry -PRON- be unfort'nate
stiggs do over again there go another counterpane god pity -PRON- poor
mother!--it will be the ruin of -PRON- house have the poor lad a sister
where be that girl there betty go to snarles the painter and tell
-PRON- to paint -PRON- a sign with--"no suicide permit here and no
smoking in the parlor may as well kill both bird at once kill
the lord be merciful to -PRON- ghost what be that noise there -PRON- young
man avast there

and run up after -PRON- -PRON- catch -PRON- as -PRON- be again try to force
open the door

-PRON- do not allow -PRON- -PRON- will not have -PRON- premise spoil go for the
locksmith there be one about a mile from here but avast put -PRON-
hand in -PRON- side pocket here be a key that will fit -PRON- gues let 's
see and with that -PRON- turn -PRON- in the lock but alas queequeg 's
supplemental bolt remain unwithdrawn within

have to burst -PRON- open say -PRON- and be run down the entry a
little for a good start when the landlady catch at -PRON- again vow
-PRON- should not break down -PRON- premise but -PRON- tear from -PRON- and with a
sudden bodily rush dash -PRON- full against the mark

with a prodigious noise the door fly open and the knob slam
against the wall send the plaster to the ceiling and there good
heaven there sit queequeg altogether cool and self collect right
in the middle of the room squat on -PRON- ham and hold yojo on
top of -PRON- head -PRON- look neither one way nor the other way but sit
like a carve image with scarce a sign of active life

queequeg say -PRON- go up to -PRON- queequeg what be the matter with
-PRON-

-PRON- hain't be a sittin so all day have -PRON- say the landlady

but all -PRON- say not a word could -PRON- drag out of -PRON- -PRON- almost feel
like push -PRON- over so as to change -PRON- position for -PRON- be almost
intolerable -PRON- seem so painfully and unnaturally constrain
especially as in all probability -PRON- have be sit so for upward of
eight or ten hour go too without -PRON- regular meal

mrs. hussey say -PRON- -PRON- be alive at all event so leave -PRON- if -PRON-
please and -PRON- will see to this strange affair -PRON-

close the door upon the landlady -PRON- endeavor to prevail upon
queequeg to take a chair but in vain there -PRON- sit and all -PRON- could
do for all -PRON- polite art and blandishment -PRON- would not move a peg
nor say a single word nor even look at -PRON- nor notice -PRON- presence in
the slight way

-PRON- wonder think -PRON- if this can possibly be a part of -PRON- ramadan do
-PRON- fast on -PRON- ham that way in -PRON- native island -PRON- must be so
yes -PRON- be part of -PRON- creed -PRON- suppose well then let -PRON- rest -PRON- will
get up sooner or later no doubt -PRON- can not last for ever thank god
and -PRON- ramadan only come once a year and -PRON- do not believe -PRON- be very
punctual then

-PRON- go down to supper after sit a long time listen to the long
story of some sailor who have just come from a plum pudding voyage as
-PRON- call -PRON- that be a short whaling voyage in a schooner or brig
confine to the north of the line in the atlantic ocean only after
listen to these plum puddinger till nearly eleven o'clock -PRON- go
up stair to go to bed feel quite sure by this time queequeg must
certainly have bring -PRON- ramadan to a termination but no there -PRON-
be just where -PRON- have leave -PRON- -PRON- have not stir an inch -PRON- begin to
grow vexed with -PRON- -PRON- seem so downright senseless and insane to be
sit there all day and half the night on -PRON- ham in a cold room
hold a piece of wood on -PRON- head

for heaven 's sake queequeg get up and shake -PRON- get up and have
some supper -PRON- will starve -PRON- will kill -PRON- queequeg but not a
word do -PRON- reply

despairing of -PRON- therefore -PRON- determine to go to bed and to sleep
and no doubt before a great while -PRON- would follow -PRON- but previous to
turn in -PRON- take -PRON- heavy bearskin jacket and throw -PRON- over -PRON- as
-PRON- promise to be a very cold night and -PRON- have nothing but -PRON- ordinary
round jacket on for some time do all -PRON- would -PRON- could not get into
the faint doze -PRON- have blow out the candle and the mere thought
of queequeg not four foot off sit there in that uneasy position
stark alone in the cold and dark this make -PRON- really wretched think of
-PRON- sleep all night in the same room with a wide awake pagan on -PRON-
ham in this dreary unaccountable ramadan

but somehow -PRON- drop off at last and know nothing more till break of
day when look over the bedside there squat queequeg as if -PRON-
have be screw down to the floor but as soon as the first glimpse of
sun enter the window up -PRON- get with stiff and grating joint
but with a cheerful look limp towards -PRON- where -PRON- lie press -PRON-
forehead again against mine and say -PRON- ramadan be over

now as -PRON- before hint -PRON- have no objection to any person 's religion
be -PRON- what -PRON- may so long as that person do not kill or insult any
other person because that other person do not believe -PRON- also but when
a man 's religion become really frantic when -PRON- be a positive torment
to -PRON- and in fine make this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to
lodge in then -PRON- think -PRON- high time to take that individual aside and
argue the point with -PRON-

and just so -PRON- now do with queequeg queequeg say -PRON- get into bed
now and lie and listen to -PRON- -PRON- then go on begin with the rise
and progress of the primitive religion and come down to the various
religion of the present time during which time -PRON- labor to show
queequeg that all these lent ramadans and prolong ham squatting in
cold cheerless room be stark nonsense bad for the health useless
for the soul oppose in short to the obvious law of hygiene and
common sense -PRON- tell -PRON- too that -PRON- be in other thing such an
extremely sensible and sagacious savage -PRON- pain -PRON- very badly pained
-PRON- to see -PRON- now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous ramadan
of -PRON- besides argue -PRON- fast make the body cave in hence the
spirit cave in and all thought bear of a fast must necessarily be
half starve this be the reason why most dyspeptic religionist cherish
such melancholy notion about -PRON- hereafter in one word queequeg
say -PRON- rather digressively hell be an idea first bear on an undigested
apple dumpling and since then perpetuate through the hereditary
dyspepsia nurture by ramadans

-PRON- then ask queequeg whether -PRON- -PRON- be ever trouble with
dyspepsia express the idea very plainly so that -PRON- could take -PRON-
in -PRON- say no only upon one memorable occasion -PRON- be after a great
feast give by -PRON- father the king on the gaining of a great battle
wherein fifty of the enemy have be kill by about two o'clock in the
afternoon and all cook and eat that very evening

no more queequeg say -PRON- shuddering that will do for -PRON- know the
inference without -PRON- further hint -PRON- -PRON- have see a sailor who have
visit that very island and -PRON- tell -PRON- that -PRON- be the custom when
a great battle have be gain there to barbecue all the slain in the
yard or garden of the victor and then one by one -PRON- be place
in great wooden trencher and garnish round like a pilau with
breadfruit and cocoanut and with some parsley in -PRON- mouth be
send round with the victor 's compliment to all -PRON- friend just as
though these present be so many christmas turkey

after all -PRON- do not think that -PRON- remark about religion make much
impression upon queequeg because in the first place -PRON- somehow seem
dull of hear on that important subject unless consider from -PRON-
own point of view and in the second place -PRON- do not more than one
third understand -PRON- couch -PRON- idea simply as -PRON- would and finally -PRON-
no doubt think -PRON- know a good deal more about the true religion than
-PRON- do -PRON- look at -PRON- with a sort of condescending concern and
compassion as though -PRON- think -PRON- a great pity that such a sensible
young man should be so hopelessly lose to evangelical pagan piety

at last -PRON- rise and dress and queequeg take a prodigiously hearty
breakfast of chowder of all sort so that the landlady should not
make much profit by reason of -PRON- ramadan -PRON- sally out to board the
pequod sauntering along and pick -PRON- tooth with halibut bone



chapter 18 -PRON- mark


as -PRON- be walk down the end of the wharf towards the ship queequeg
carry -PRON- harpoon captain peleg in -PRON- gruff voice loudly hail -PRON-
from -PRON- wigwam say -PRON- have not suspect -PRON- friend be a cannibal

bulwark and leave -PRON- comrade stand on the wharf

nothing but a humbug try to be a bugbear but -PRON- have not go
perhaps above a hundred yard when chance to turn a corner and
look back as -PRON- do so who should be see but elijah follow -PRON-
though at a distance somehow the sight of -PRON- strike -PRON- so that -PRON-
say nothing to queequeg of -PRON- be behind but pass on with -PRON-
comrade anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the same corner
that -PRON- do -PRON- do and then -PRON- seem to -PRON- that -PRON- be dog
-PRON- but with what intent -PRON- could not for the life of -PRON- imagine this
circumstance couple with -PRON- ambiguous half hint half reveal
shroud sort of talk now beget in -PRON- all kind of vague wonderment
and half apprehension and all connect with the pequod and captain
ahab and the leg -PRON- have lose and the cape horn fit and the silver
calabash and what captain peleg have say of -PRON- when -PRON- leave the ship
the day previous and the prediction of the squaw tistig and the voyage

-PRON- be resolve to satisfy -PRON- whether this ragged elijah be really
dog -PRON- or not and with that intent cross the way with queequeg
and on that side of -PRON- retrace -PRON- step but elijah pass on without
seem to notice -PRON- this relieve -PRON- and once more and finally as -PRON-
seem to -PRON- -PRON- pronounce -PRON- in -PRON- heart a humbug



chapter 20 all astir


a day or two pass and there be great activity aboard the pequod
not only be the old sail be mend but new sail be come on
board and bolt of canvas and coil of rigging in short everything
betoken that the ship 's preparation be hurry to a close captain
peleg seldom or never go ashore but sit in -PRON- wigwam keep a sharp
look out upon the hand bildad do all the purchasing and provide
at the store and the man employ in the hold and on the rig be
work till long after night fall

on the day follow queequeg 's sign the article word be give at
all the inn where the ship 's company be stop that -PRON- chest
must be on board before night for there be no tell how soon
the vessel may be sail so queequeg and -PRON- get down -PRON- trap
resolve however to sleep ashore till the last but -PRON- seem -PRON-
always give very long notice in these case and the ship do not sail
for several day but no wonder there be a good deal to be do and
there be no tell how many thing to be think of before the pequod
be fully equip

every one know what a multitude of thing bed sauce pan knife
and fork shovel and tong napkin nut cracker and what not be
indispensable to the business of housekeeping just so with whaling
which necessitate a three year housekeeping upon the wide ocean
far from all grocer costermonger doctor baker and banker and
though this also hold true of merchant vessel yet not by any mean
to the same extent as with whalemen for besides the great length of the
whaling voyage the numerous article peculiar to the prosecution of the
fishery and the impossibility of replace -PRON- at the remote harbor
usually frequent -PRON- must be remember that of all ship whale
vessel be the most expose to accident of all kind and especially
to the destruction and loss of the very thing upon which the success of
the voyage most depend hence the spare boat spare spar and spare
line and harpoon and spare everything almost but a spare captain
and duplicate ship

at the period of -PRON- arrival at the island the heavy storage of the
pequod have be almost complete comprise -PRON- beef bread water
fuel and iron hoop and stave but as before hint for some time
there be a continual fetching and carry on board of diver odd and
end of thing both large and small

chief among those who do this fetching and carrying be captain
bildad 's sister a lean old lady of a most determined and indefatigable
spirit but withal very kindheart who seem resolve that if she
could help -PRON- nothing should be find want in the pequod after once
fairly get to sea at one time -PRON- would come on board with a jar
of pickle for the steward 's pantry another time with a bunch of quill
for the chief mate 's desk where -PRON- keep -PRON- log a third time with a
roll of flannel for the small of some one 's rheumatic back never do
any woman better deserve -PRON- name which be charity aunt charity as
everybody call -PRON- and like a sister of charity do this charitable
aunt charity bustle about hither and thither ready to turn -PRON- hand
and heart to anything that promise to yield safety comfort and
consolation to all on board a ship in which -PRON- beloved brother
bildad be concern and in which -PRON- -PRON- own a score or two of
well save dollar

but -PRON- be startling to see this excellent hearted quakeress come on
board as -PRON- do the last day with a long oil ladle in one hand and
a still longer whale lance in the other nor be bildad -PRON- nor
captain peleg at all backward as for bildad -PRON- carry about with -PRON-
a long list of the article need and at every fresh arrival down
go -PRON- mark opposite that article upon the paper every once in a
while peleg come hobble out of -PRON- whalebone den roar at the man
down the hatchway roar up to the rigger at the mast head and then
conclude by roar back into -PRON- wigwam

during these day of preparation queequeg and -PRON- often visit the
craft and as often -PRON- ask about captain ahab and how -PRON- be and when
-PRON- be go to come on board -PRON- ship to these question -PRON- would
answer that -PRON- be get good and good and be expect aboard
every day meantime the two captain peleg and bildad could attend
to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage if -PRON- have be
downright honest with -PRON- -PRON- would have see very plainly in -PRON- heart
that -PRON- do but half fancy being commit this way to so long a voyage
without once lay -PRON- eye on the man who be to be the absolute
dictator of -PRON- so soon as the ship sail out upon the open sea
but when a man suspect any wrong -PRON- sometimes happen that if -PRON- be
already involve in the matter -PRON- insensibly strive to cover up -PRON-
suspicion even from -PRON- and much this way -PRON- be with -PRON- -PRON- say
nothing and try to think nothing

at last -PRON- be give out that some time next day the ship would
certainly sail so next morning queequeg and -PRON- take a very early start



chapter 21 go aboard


-PRON- be nearly six o'clock but only grey imperfect misty dawn when -PRON-
draw nigh the wharf

glance

elijah say -PRON- -PRON- will oblige -PRON- friend and -PRON- by withdraw -PRON-

ye shall not see ye again very soon -PRON- gues unless -PRON- be before the grand
jury and with these crack word -PRON- finally depart leave -PRON- for
the moment in no small wonderment at -PRON- frantic impudence

at last step on board the pequod -PRON- find everything in profound
quiet not a soul move the cabin entrance be lock within the
hatch be all on and lumbered with coil of rigging go forward
to the forecastle -PRON- find the slide of the scuttle open see a
light -PRON- go down and find only an old rigger there wrap in a
tattered pea jacket -PRON- be throw at whole length upon two chest -PRON-
face downward and inclose in -PRON- fold arm the profound slumber
sleep upon -PRON-

those sailor -PRON- see queequeg where can -PRON- have go to say -PRON-
look dubiously at the sleeper but -PRON- seem that when on the wharf
queequeg have not at all notice what -PRON- now allude to hence -PRON- would
have think -PRON- to have be optically deceive in that matter
be -PRON- not for elijah 's otherwise inexplicable question but -PRON- beat the
thing down and again mark the sleeper jocularly hint to queequeg
that perhaps -PRON- have best sit up with the body tell -PRON- to establish
-PRON- accordingly -PRON- put -PRON- hand upon the sleeper 's rear as though
feel if -PRON- be soft enough and then without more ado sit quietly
down there

gracious queequeg do not sit there say i.

oh perry dood seat say queequeg -PRON- country way will not hurt -PRON-

queequeg remove -PRON- to just beyond the head of the sleeper and
light -PRON- tomahawk pipe -PRON- sit at the foot -PRON- keep the pipe pass
over the sleeper from one to the other meanwhile upon question -PRON-
in -PRON- broken fashion queequeg give -PRON- to understand that in -PRON-
land owe to the absence of settee and sofas of all sort the king
chief and great people generally be in the custom of fatten some
of the low order for othman and to furnish a house comfortably in
that respect -PRON- have only to buy up eight or ten lazy fellow and lie
-PRON- round in the pier and alcove besides -PRON- be very convenient on
an excursion much good than those garden chair which be convertible
into walking stick upon occasion a chief call -PRON- attendant and
desire -PRON- to make a settee of -PRON- under a spread tree perhaps
in some damp marshy place

while narrate these thing every time queequeg receive the tomahawk
from -PRON- -PRON- flourish the hatchet side of -PRON- over the sleeper 's head

what be that for queequeg

perry easy kill e oh perry easy

-PRON- be go on with some wild reminiscence about -PRON- tomahawk pipe
which -PRON- seem have in -PRON- two us both brain -PRON- foe and soothe
-PRON- soul when -PRON- be directly attract to the sleeping rigger the
strong vapour now completely fill the contract hole -PRON- begin
to tell upon -PRON- -PRON- breathe with a sort of muffledness then seem
troubled in the nose then revolve over once or twice then sit up and
rub -PRON- eye

hear a noise on deck

holloa starbuck 's astir say the rigger -PRON- be a lively chief mate
that good man and a pious but all alive now -PRON- must turn to and so
say -PRON- go on deck and -PRON- follow

-PRON- be now clear sunrise soon the crew come on board in two and
three the rigger bestir -PRON- the mate be actively
engage and several of the shore people be busy in bring various
last thing on board meanwhile captain ahab remain invisibly
enshrine within -PRON- cabin



chapter 22 merry christmas


at length towards noon upon the final dismissal of the ship 's rigger
and after the pequod have be haul out from the wharf and after the
ever thoughtful charity have come off in a whale boat with -PRON- last
gift a night cap for stubb the second mate -PRON- brother in law and a
spare bible for the steward after all this the two captain peleg
and bildad issue from the cabin and turn to the chief mate peleg
say

now mr. starbuck be -PRON- sure everything be right captain ahab be
all ready just speak to -PRON- nothing more to be get from shore eh
well call all hand then muster 'em aft here blast em

no need of profane word however great the hurry peleg say bildad
but away with thee friend starbuck and do -PRON- bidding

how now here upon the very point of start for the voyage captain
peleg and captain bildad be go -PRON- with a high hand on the
quarter deck just as if -PRON- be to be joint commander at sea as
well as to all appearance in port and as for captain ahab no sign of
-PRON- be yet to be see only -PRON- say -PRON- be in the cabin but then
the idea be that -PRON- presence be by no mean necessary in get the
ship under weigh and steer -PRON- well out to sea indeed as that be
not at all -PRON- proper business but the pilot 's and as -PRON- be not
yet completely recover so -PRON- say therefore captain ahab stay
below and all this seem natural enough especially as in the merchant
service many captain never show -PRON- on deck for a considerable
time after heave up the anchor but remain over the cabin table
have a farewell merry make with -PRON- shore friend before -PRON-
quit the ship for good with the pilot

but there be not much chance to think over the matter for captain
peleg be now all alive -PRON- seem to do most of the talking and
command and not bildad

aft here ye son of bachelor -PRON- cry as the sailor linger at
the main mast mr. starbuck drive'em aft

strike the tent there!"--wa the next order as -PRON- hint before this
whalebone marquee be never pitch except in port and on board the
pequod for thirty year the order to strike the tent be well know to
be the next thing to heave up the anchor

man the capstan blood and thunder!--jump!"--was the next command and
the crew spring for the handspike

now in get under weigh the station generally occupy by the pilot
be the forward part of the ship and here bildad who with peleg be -PRON-
know in addition to -PRON- other officer be one of the license pilot
of the port -PRON- be suspect to have get -PRON- make a pilot in
order to save the nantucket pilot fee to all the ship -PRON- be concern
in for -PRON- never pilot any other craft bildad -PRON- say may now
be see actively engage in look over the bow for the approach
anchor and at interval sing what seem a dismal stave of psalmody
to cheer the hand at the windlass who roar forth some sort of
a chorus about the girl in booble alley with hearty good will
nevertheless not three day previous bildad have tell -PRON- that no
profane song would be allow on board the pequod particularly in
get under weigh and charity -PRON- sister have place a small choice
copy of watts in each seaman 's berth

meantime oversee the other part of the ship captain peleg rip
and swear astern in the most frightful manner -PRON- almost think -PRON- would
sink the ship before the anchor could be get up involuntarily -PRON- pause
on -PRON- handspike and tell queequeg to do the same think of the
peril -PRON- both run in start on the voyage with such a devil for a
pilot -PRON- be comfort -PRON- however with the thought that in pious
bildad may be find some salvation spite of -PRON- seven hundred and
seventy seventh lay when -PRON- feel a sudden sharp poke in -PRON- rear and
turn round be horrify at the apparition of captain peleg in the
act of withdraw -PRON- leg from -PRON- immediate vicinity that be -PRON- first
kick

be that the way -PRON- heave in the marchant service -PRON- roar
spring thou sheep head spring and break thy backbone why do not ye
spring -PRON- say all of ye spring quohog spring thou chap with the red
whisker spring there scotch cap spring thou green pant spring -PRON-
say all of ye and spring -PRON- eye out and so say -PRON- move
along the windlass here and there use -PRON- leg very freely while
imperturbable bildad keep lead off with -PRON- psalmody think -PRON-
captain peleg must have be drink something to day

at last the anchor be up the sail be set and off -PRON- glide -PRON-
be a short cold christmas and as the short northern day merge into
night -PRON- find -PRON- almost broad upon the wintry ocean whose
freeze spray case -PRON- in ice as in polished armor the long row of
tooth on the bulwark glisten in the moonlight and like the white
ivory tusk of some huge elephant vast curving icicle depend from
the bow

lank bildad as pilot head the first watch and ever and anon as the
old craft deep dive into the green sea and send the shivering frost
all over -PRON- and the wind howl and the cordage ring -PRON- steady
note be heard,--

sweet field beyond the swell flood stand dress in live green
so to the jews old canaan stand while jordan roll between


never do those sweet word sound more sweetly to -PRON- than then -PRON-
be full of hope and fruition spite of this frigid winter night in the
boisterous atlantic spite of -PRON- wet foot and wet jacket there be
yet -PRON- then seem to -PRON- many a pleasant haven in store and mead
and glade so eternally vernal that the grass shoot up by the spring
untrodden unwilted remain at midsummer

at last -PRON- gain such an offing that the two pilot be need
no longer the stout sail boat that have accompany -PRON- begin range
alongside

-PRON- be curious and not unpleas how peleg and bildad be affect at
this juncture especially captain bildad for loath to depart yet
very loath to leave for good a ship bind on so long and perilous a
voyage beyond both stormy capes a ship in which some thousand of
-PRON- hard earn dollar be invest a ship in which an old shipmate
sail as captain a man almost as old as -PRON- once more start to
encounter all the terror of the pitiless jaw loath to say good bye to
a thing so every way brimful of every interest to -PRON- poor old bildad
linger long pace the deck with anxious stride run down into the
cabin to speak another farewell word there again come on deck and
look to windward look towards the wide and endless water only
bound by the far off unseen eastern continents look towards
the land look aloft look right and leave look everywhere
and nowhere and at last mechanically coil a rope upon -PRON- pin
convulsively grasp stout peleg by the hand and hold up a lantern
for a moment stand gaze heroically in -PRON- face as much as to say
nevertheless friend peleg -PRON- can stand -PRON- yes -PRON- can

as for peleg -PRON- -PRON- take -PRON- more like a philosopher but for all
-PRON- philosophy there be a tear twinkling in -PRON- eye when the lantern
come too near and -PRON- too do not a little run from cabin to deck now
a word below and now a word with starbuck the chief mate

but at last -PRON- turn to -PRON- comrade with a final sort of look
about him,--"captain bildad come old shipmate -PRON- must go back the
main yard there boat ahoy stand by to come close alongside now
careful careful!--come bildad boy say -PRON- last luck to ye
starbuck luck to ye mr. stubb luck to ye mr. flask good bye and
good luck to ye all and this day three year -PRON- will have a hot supper
smoking for ye in old nantucket hurrah and away

god bles ye and have ye in -PRON- holy keeping man murmur old
bildad almost incoherently -PRON- hope ye'll have fine weather now so
that captain ahab may soon be move among ye a pleasant sun be all
-PRON- need and ye'll have plenty of -PRON- in the tropic voyage ye go
be careful in the hunt ye mate do not stave the boat needlessly
ye harpooneer good white cedar plank be raise full three per cent
within the year do not forget -PRON- prayer either mr. starbuck mind
that cooper do not waste the spare stave oh the sail needle be in
the green locker do not whale -PRON- too much a lord 's day man but do not
miss a fair chance either that be reject heaven 's good gift have an
eye to the molass tierce mr. stubb -PRON- be a little leaky -PRON- think
if ye touch at the island mr. flask beware of fornication good bye

starbuck -PRON- will spoil be careful with the butter twenty cent the
pound -PRON- be and mind ye if--

come come captain bildad stop palaver away and with that
peleg hurry -PRON- over the side and both dropt into the boat

ship and boat diverge the cold damp night breeze blow between a
scream gull fly overhead the two hull wildly roll -PRON- give
three heavy hearted cheer and blindly plunge like fate into the lone
atlantic



chapter 23 the lee shore


some chapter back one bulkington be speak of a tall newlanded
mariner encounter in new bedford at the inn

when on that shiver winter 's night the pequod thrust -PRON- vindictive
bow into the cold malicious wave who should -PRON- see stand at -PRON-
helm but bulkington -PRON- look with sympathetic awe and fearfulness upon
the man who in mid winter just land from a four year dangerous
voyage could so unrestingly push off again for still another
tempestuous term the land seem scorch to -PRON- foot wonderfull
thing be ever the unmentionable deep memory yield no epitaphs this
six inch chapter be the stoneless grave of bulkington let -PRON- only say
that -PRON- fare with -PRON- as with the storm toss ship that miserably
drive along the leeward land the port would fain give succor the port
be pitiful in the port be safety comfort hearthstone supper warm
blanket friend all that be kind to -PRON- mortality but in that gale
the port the land be that ship 's direst jeopardy -PRON- must fly all
hospitality one touch of land though -PRON- but graze the keel would make
-PRON- shudder through and through with all -PRON- might -PRON- crowd all sail
off shore in so do fight gainst the very wind that fain would
blow -PRON- homeward seek all the lashed sea 's landlessness again
for refuge 's sake forlornly rush into peril -PRON- only friend -PRON-
bitter foe

know ye now bulkington glimpse do ye seem to see of that mortally
intolerable truth that all deep earnest thinking be but the intrepid
effort of the soul to keep the open independence of -PRON- sea while
the wild wind of heaven and earth conspire to cast -PRON- on the
treacherous slavish shore

but as in landlessness alone reside high truth shoreless
indefinite as god so good be -PRON- to perish in that howl infinite
than be ingloriously dash upon the lee even if that be safety
for worm like then oh who would craven crawl to land terror of
the terrible be all this agony so vain take heart take heart
o bulkington bear thee grimly demigod up from the spray of thy
ocean perishing straight up leap thy apotheosis



chapter 24 the advocate


as queequeg and -PRON- be now fairly embark in this business of whaling
and as this business of whaling have somehow come to be regard among
landsman as a rather unpoetical and disreputable pursuit therefore -PRON-
be all anxiety to convince ye ye landsmen of the injustice hereby do
to -PRON- hunter of whale

in the first place -PRON- may be deem almost superfluous to establish
the fact that among people at large the business of whaling be not
account on a level with what be call the liberal profession if a
stranger be introduce into any miscellaneous metropolitan society
-PRON- would but slightly advance the general opinion of -PRON- merit be
-PRON- present to the company as a harpooneer say and if in emulation
of the naval officer -PRON- should append the initial s.w.f. sperm
whale fishery to -PRON- visit card such a procedure would be deem
pre eminently presuming and ridiculous

doubtless one lead reason why the world decline honour -PRON-
whaleman be this -PRON- think that at good -PRON- vocation amount to a
butcher sort of business and that when actively engage therein -PRON-
be surround by all manner of defilement butcher -PRON- be that be
true but butcher also and butcher of the bloody badge have be
all martial commander whom the world invariably delight to honour and
as for the matter of the allege uncleanliness of -PRON- business ye shall
soon be initiate into certain fact hitherto pretty generally unknown
and which upon the whole will triumphantly plant the sperm whale ship
at least among the cleanly thing of this tidy earth but even
grant the charge in question to be true what disordered slippery
deck of a whale ship be comparable to the unspeakable carrion of those
battle field from which so many soldier return to drink in all lady
plaudit and if the idea of peril so much enhance the popular conceit
of the soldier 's profession let -PRON- assure ye that many a veteran
who have freely march up to a battery would quickly recoil at the
apparition of the sperm whale 's vast tail fan into eddy the air
over -PRON- head for what be the comprehensible terror of man compare
with the interlinked terror and wonder of god

but though the world scout at -PRON- whale hunter yet do -PRON-
unwittingly pay -PRON- the profound homage yea an all abound
adoration for almost all the taper lamp and candle that burn round
the globe burn as before so many shrine to -PRON- glory

but look at this matter in other light weigh -PRON- in all sort of
scale see what -PRON- whaleman be and have be

why do the dutch in de witt 's time have admiral of -PRON- whaling
fleet why do louis xvi of france at -PRON- own personal expense fit
out whale ship from dunkirk and politely invite to that town some
score or two of family from -PRON- own island of nantucket why do
britain between the year 1750 and 1788 pay to -PRON- whaleman in bounty
upward of l1,000,000 and lastly how come -PRON- that -PRON- whaleman of
america now outnumber all the rest of the band whaleman in the world
sail a navy of upward of seven hundred vessel man by eighteen
thousand man yearly consume 4,000,000 of dollar the ship worth
at the time of sailing $ 20,000,000 and every year import into -PRON-
harbor a well reap harvest of $ 7,000,000 how come all this if
there be not something puissant in whaling

but this be not the half look again

-PRON- freely assert that the cosmopolite philosopher can not for -PRON- life
point out one single peaceful influence which within the last sixty
year have operate more potentially upon the whole broad world take in
one aggregate than the high and mighty business of whaling one way
and another -PRON- have beget event so remarkable in -PRON- and so
continuously momentous in -PRON- sequential issue that whaling may
well be regard as that egyptian mother who bear offspr -PRON-
pregnant from -PRON- womb -PRON- would be a hopeless endless task to
catalogue all these thing let a handful suffice for many year past
the whale ship have be the pioneer in ferret out the remotest and
least known part of the earth -PRON- have explore sea and archipelago
which have no chart where no cook or vancouver have ever sail if
american and european man of war now peacefully ride in once savage
harbor let -PRON- fire salute to the honour and glory of the
whale ship which originally show -PRON- the way and first interpret
between -PRON- and the savage -PRON- may celebrate as -PRON- will the hero
of exploring expeditions -PRON- cooks -PRON- krusensterns but -PRON- say that
score of anonymous captain have sail out of nantucket that be
as great and great than -PRON- cook and -PRON- krusenstern for in -PRON-
succourless empty handedness -PRON- in the heathenish shark water
and by the beach of unrecorded javelin island battle with virgin
wonder and terror that cook with all -PRON- marine and musket would
not willingly have dare all that be make such a flourish of in the old
south sea voyages those thing be but the life time commonplace of
-PRON- heroic nantucketer often adventure which vancouver dedicate
three chapter to these man account unworthy of be set down in the
ship 's common log ah the world oh the world

until the whale fishery round cape horn no commerce but colonial
scarcely any intercourse but colonial be carry on between europe and
the long line of the opulent spanish province on the pacific coast
-PRON- be the whaleman who first break through the jealous policy of the
spanish crown touch those colony and if space permit -PRON-
may be distinctly show how from those whaleman at last eventuate the
liberation of peru chili and bolivia from the yoke of old spain and
the establishment of the eternal democracy in those part

that great america on the other side of the sphere australia be give
to the enlightened world by the whaleman after -PRON- first blunder bear
discovery by a dutchman all other ship long shun those shore
as pestiferously barbarous but the whale ship touch there the
whale ship be the true mother of that now mighty colony moreover
in the infancy of the first australian settlement the emigrant be
several time save from starvation by the benevolent biscuit of the
whale ship luckily drop an anchor in -PRON- water the uncounted
isle of all polynesia confess the same truth and do commercial homage
to the whale ship that clear the way for the missionary and the
merchant and in many case carry the primitive missionary to -PRON-
first destination if that double bolt land japan be ever to become
hospitable -PRON- be the whale ship alone to whom the credit will be due
for already -PRON- be on the threshold

but if in the face of all this -PRON- still declare that whaling have no
aesthetically noble association connect with -PRON- then be -PRON- ready to
shiver fifty lance with -PRON- there and unhorse -PRON- with a split helmet
every time

the whale have no famous author and whale no famous chronicler -PRON-
will say

the whale no famous author and whaling no famous chronicler who write
the first account of -PRON- leviathan who but mighty job and who compose
the first narrative of a whaling voyage who but no less a prince than
alfred the great who with -PRON- own royal pen take down the word from
other the norwegian whale hunter of those time and who pronounce -PRON-
glow eulogy in parliament who but edmund burke

true enough but then whalemen -PRON- be poor devil -PRON- have no
good blood in -PRON- vein

no good blood in their veins -PRON- have something good than royal
blood there the grandmother of benjamin franklin be mary morrel
afterwards by marriage mary folger one of the old settler
of nantucket and the ancestress to a long line of folgers and
harpooneer all kith and kin to noble benjamin this day dart the
barbed iron from one side of the world to the other

good again but then all confess that somehow whaling be not
respectable

whaling not respectable whaling be imperial by old english statutory
law the whale be declare a royal fish

oh that be only nominal the whale -PRON- have never figure in any
grand impose way

the whale never figure in any grand imposing way in one of the mighty
triumph give to a roman general upon -PRON- enter the world 's capital
the bone of a whale bring all the way from the syrian coast be
the most conspicuous object in the cymball procession


see subsequent chapter for something more on this head


grant -PRON- since -PRON- cite -PRON- but say what -PRON- will there be no real
dignity in whaling

no dignity in whaling the dignity of -PRON- call the very heaven
attest cetus be a constellation in the south no more drive down -PRON-
hat in presence of the czar and take -PRON- off to queequeg no more -PRON-
know a man that in -PRON- lifetime have take three hundred and fifty
whale -PRON- account that man more honourable than that great captain of
antiquity who boast of take as many wall town

and as for -PRON- if by any possibility there be any as yet undiscovered
prime thing in -PRON- if -PRON- shall ever deserve any real repute in that small
but high hush world which -PRON- may not be unreasonably ambitious of if
hereafter -PRON- shall do anything that upon the whole a man may rather
have do than to have leave undone if at -PRON- death -PRON- executor or
more properly -PRON- creditor find any precious mss in -PRON- desk then here
-PRON- prospectively ascribe all the honour and the glory to whaling for a
whale ship be -PRON- yale college and -PRON- harvard



chapter 25 postscript


in behalf of the dignity of whaling -PRON- would fain advance naught but
substantiate fact but after embattle -PRON- fact an advocate who
should wholly suppress a not unreasonable surmise which may
tell eloquently upon -PRON- cause such an advocate would -PRON- not be
blameworthy

-PRON- be well know that at the coronation of king and queen even modern
one a certain curious process of season -PRON- for -PRON- function be
go through there be a saltcellar of state so call and there
may be a castor of state how -PRON- use the salt precisely who know
certain -PRON- be however that a king 's head be solemnly oil at -PRON-
coronation even as a head of salad can -PRON- be though that -PRON-
anoint -PRON- with a view of make -PRON- interior run well as -PRON- anoint
machinery much may be ruminate here concern the essential
dignity of this regal process because in common life -PRON- esteem but
meanly and contemptibly a fellow who anoint -PRON- hair and palpably
smell of that anointing in truth a mature man who use hair oil
unless medicinally that man have probably get a quoggy spot in -PRON-
somewhere as a general rule -PRON- can not amount to much in -PRON- totality

but the only thing to be consider here be this what kind of oil be
use at coronation certainly -PRON- can not be olive oil nor macassar oil
nor castor oil nor bear 's oil nor train oil nor cod liver oil what
then can -PRON- possibly be but sperm oil in -PRON- unmanufactured unpolluted
state the sweet of all oil

think of that ye loyal briton -PRON- whalemen supply -PRON- king and
queen with coronation stuff



chapter 26 knight and squires


the chief mate of the pequod be starbuck a native of nantucket and a
quaker by descent -PRON- be a long earnest man and though bear on an icy
coast seem well adapted to endure hot latitude -PRON- flesh be hard
as twice bake biscuit transport to the indies -PRON- live blood would
not spoil like bottled ale -PRON- must have be bear in some time of
general drought and famine or upon one of those fast day for which
-PRON- state be famous only some thirty arid summer have -PRON- see those
summer have dry up all -PRON- physical superfluousness but this -PRON-
thinness so to speak seem no more the token of waste anxiety and
care than -PRON- seem the indication of any bodily blight -PRON- be merely
the condensation of the man -PRON- be by no mean ill look quite the
contrary -PRON- pure tight skin be an excellent fit and closely wrap
up in -PRON- and embalm with inner health and strength like a revivified
egyptian this starbuck seem prepared to endure for long age to come
and to endure always as now for be -PRON- polar snow or torrid sun like
a patent chronometer -PRON- interior vitality be warrant to do well
in all climate look into -PRON- eye -PRON- seem to see there the yet
linger image of those thousand fold peril -PRON- have calmly confront
through life a staid steadfast man whose life for the most part be a
tell pantomime of action and not a tame chapter of sound yet for
all -PRON- hardy sobriety and fortitude there be certain quality
in -PRON- which at time affect and in some case seem well nigh to
overbalance all the rest uncommonly conscientious for a seaman and
endue with a deep natural reverence the wild watery loneliness of -PRON-
life do therefore strongly incline -PRON- to superstition but to that
sort of superstition which in some organization seem rather to
spring somehow from intelligence than from ignorance outward portent
and inward presentiment be -PRON- and if at time these thing bend the
weld iron of -PRON- soul much more do -PRON- far away domestic memory
of -PRON- young cape wife and child tend to bend -PRON- still more from the
original ruggedness of -PRON- nature and open -PRON- still further to those
latent influence which in some honest hearted man restrain the gush
of dare devil daring so often evince by other in the more perilous
vicissitude of the fishery -PRON- will have no man in -PRON- boat say
starbuck who be not afraid of a whale by this -PRON- seem to mean
not only that the most reliable and useful courage be that which arise
from the fair estimation of the encounter peril but that an utterly
fearless man be a far more dangerous comrade than a coward

aye aye say stubb the second mate starbuck there be as careful
a man as -PRON- will find anywhere in this fishery but -PRON- shall ere long
see what that word careful precisely mean when use by a man like
stubb or almost any other whale hunter

starbuck be no crusader after peril in -PRON- courage be not a
sentiment but a thing simply useful to -PRON- and always at hand upon all
mortally practical occasion besides -PRON- think perhaps that in this
business of whaling courage be one of the great staple outfit of
the ship like -PRON- beef and -PRON- bread and not to be foolishly waste
wherefore -PRON- have no fancy for lower for whale after sun down nor
for persist in fight a fish that too much persist in fight
-PRON- for think starbuck -PRON- be here in this critical ocean to kill
whale for -PRON- living and not to be kill by -PRON- for -PRON- and that
hundred of man have be so kill starbuck well know what doom be
-PRON- own father 's where in the bottomless deep could -PRON- find the torn
limb of -PRON- brother

with memory like these in -PRON- and moreover give to a certain
superstitiousness as have be say the courage of this starbuck which
could nevertheless still flourish must indeed have be extreme but
-PRON- be not in reasonable nature that a man so organized and with such
terrible experience and remembrance as -PRON- have -PRON- be not in nature
that these thing should fail in latently engender an element in
-PRON- which under suitable circumstance would break out from -PRON-
confinement and burn all -PRON- courage up and brave as -PRON- may be -PRON-
be that sort of bravery chiefly visible in some intrepid man which
while generally abide firm in the conflict with sea or wind or
whale or any of the ordinary irrational horror of the world yet
can not withstand those more terrific because more spiritual terror
which sometimes menace -PRON- from the concentrate brow of an enrage and
mighty man

but be the come narrative to reveal in any instance the complete
abasement of poor starbuck 's fortitude scarce may -PRON- have the heart to
write -PRON- for -PRON- be a thing most sorrowful nay shocking to expose
the fall of valour in the soul man may seem detestable as joint
stock company and nation knave fool and murderer there may be
man may have mean and meagre face but man in the ideal be so noble
and so sparkling such a grand and glowing creature that over any
ignominious blemish in -PRON- all -PRON- fellow should run to throw -PRON-
costly robe that immaculate manliness -PRON- feel within -PRON-
so far within -PRON- that -PRON- remain intact though all the outer character
seem gone bleed with keen anguish at the undraped spectacle of
a valor ruin man nor can piety -PRON- at such a shameful sight
completely stifle -PRON- upbraiding against the permit star but this
august dignity -PRON- treat of be not the dignity of king and robe but
that abound dignity which have no robed investiture thou shalt see -PRON-
shin in the arm that wield a pick or drive a spike that democratic
dignity which on all hand radiate without end from god -PRON- the
great god absolute the centre and circumference of all democracy -PRON-
omnipresence -PRON- divine equality

if then to mean mariner and renegade and castaway -PRON- shall
hereafter ascribe high quality though dark weave round -PRON- tragic
grace if even the most mournful perchance the most abased among -PRON-
all shall at time lift -PRON- to the exalted mount if -PRON- shall touch
that workman 's arm with some ethereal light if -PRON- shall spread a rainbow
over -PRON- disastrous set of sun then against all mortal critic bear
-PRON- out in -PRON- thou just spirit of equality which hast spread one royal
mantle of humanity over all -PRON- kind bear -PRON- out in -PRON- thou great
democratic god who didst not refuse to the swart convict bunyan the
pale poetic pearl thou who didst clothe with doubly hammer leave
of fine gold the stump and pauper arm of old cervantes thou who
didst pick up andrew jackson from the pebble who didst hurl -PRON- upon a
war horse who didst thunder -PRON- high than a throne thou who in all
thy mighty earthly marching ever cullest thy selectest champion from
the kingly common bear -PRON- out in -PRON- o god



chapter 27 knight and squires


stubb be the second mate -PRON- be a native of cape cod and hence
accord to local usage be call a cape cod man a happy go lucky
neither craven nor valiant take peril as -PRON- come with an
indifferent air and while engaged in the most imminent crisis of the
chase toil away calm and collect as a journeyman joiner engage
for the year good humored easy and careless -PRON- preside over -PRON-
whale boat as if the most deadly encounter be but a dinner and -PRON-
crew all invite guest -PRON- be as particular about the comfortable
arrangement of -PRON- part of the boat as an old stage driver be about the
snugness of -PRON- box when close to the whale in the very death lock of
the fight -PRON- handle -PRON- unpitying lance coolly and off handedly as
a whistle tinker -PRON- hammer -PRON- would hum over -PRON- old rigadig tune
while flank and flank with the most exasperated monster long usage have
for this stubb convert the jaw of death into an easy chair what -PRON-
thought of death -PRON- there be no tell whether -PRON- ever think of
-PRON- at all may be a question but if -PRON- ever do chance to cast -PRON-
mind that way after a comfortable dinner no doubt like a good sailor
-PRON- take -PRON- to be a sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft and bestir
-PRON- there about something which -PRON- would find out when -PRON- obey
the order and not sooner

what perhaps with other thing make stubb such an easy go
unfear man so cheerily trudge off with the burden of life in a
world full of grave pedlar all bow to the ground with -PRON- pack
what help to bring about that almost impious good humor of -PRON- that
thing must have be -PRON- pipe for like -PRON- nose -PRON- short black
little pipe be one of the regular feature of -PRON- face -PRON- would
almost as soon have expect -PRON- to turn out of -PRON- bunk without -PRON-
nose as without -PRON- pipe -PRON- keep a whole row of pipe there ready
load stick in a rack within easy reach of -PRON- hand and whenever -PRON-
turn in -PRON- smoke -PRON- all out in succession light one from
the other to the end of the chapter then load -PRON- again to be in
readiness anew for when stubb dress instead of first put -PRON-
leg into -PRON- trowser -PRON- put -PRON- pipe into -PRON- mouth

-PRON- say this continual smoking must have be one cause at least of -PRON-
peculiar disposition for every one know that this earthly air whether
ashore or afloat be terribly infect with the nameless misery of
the numberless mortal who have die exhale -PRON- and as in time of the
cholera some people go about with a camphorated handkerchief to -PRON-
mouth so likewise against all mortal tribulation stubb 's tobacco
smoke may have operate as a sort of disinfect agent

the third mate be flask a native of tisbury in martha 's vineyard a
short stout ruddy young fellow very pugnacious concerning whale
who somehow seem to think that the great leviathan have personally
and hereditarily affront -PRON- and therefore -PRON- be a sort of point of
honour with -PRON- to destroy -PRON- whenever encounter so utterly lose
be -PRON- to all sense of reverence for the many marvel of -PRON- majestic
bulk and mystic way and so dead to anything like an apprehension of
any possible danger from encounter -PRON- that in -PRON- poor opinion
the wondrous whale be but a species of magnify mouse or at least
water rat require only a little circumvention and some small
application of time and trouble in order to kill and boil this
ignorant unconscious fearlessness of -PRON- make -PRON- a little waggish in
the matter of whale -PRON- follow these fish for the fun of -PRON- and a
three year voyage round cape horn be only a jolly joke that last
that length of time as a carpenter 's nail be divide into work
nail and cut nail so mankind may be similarly divide little flask
be one of the work one make to clinch tight and last long -PRON-
call -PRON- king post on board of the pequod because in form -PRON- could
be well liken to the short square timber know by that name in arctic
whaler and which by the mean of many radiating side timber insert
into -PRON- serve to brace the ship against the icy concussion of those
batter sea

now these three mate starbuck stubb and flask be momentous
man -PRON- -PRON- be who by universal prescription command three of the
pequod 's boat as headsman in that grand order of battle in which
captain ahab would probably marshal -PRON- force to descend on the whale
these three headsman be as captain of company or be arm with
-PRON- long keen whaling spear -PRON- be as a pick trio of lancer
even as the harpooneer be flinger of javelin

and since in this famous fishery each mate or headsman like a gothic
knight of old be always accompany by -PRON- boat steerer or harpooneer
who in certain conjuncture provide -PRON- with a fresh lance when
the former one have be badly twist or elbow in the assault and
moreover as there generally subsist between the two a close intimacy
and friendliness -PRON- be therefore but meet that in this place -PRON- set
down who the pequod 's harpooneer be and to what headsman each of
-PRON- belong

first of all be queequeg whom starbuck the chief mate have select
for -PRON- squire but queequeg be already know

next be tashtego an unmixed indian from gay head the most westerly
promontory of martha 's vineyard where there still exist the last
remnant of a village of red man which have long supply the neighboring
island of nantucket with many of -PRON- most daring harpooneer in the

of the unvitiated blood of those proud warrior hunter who in quest
of the great new england moose have scour bow in hand the aboriginal
forest of the main but no longer snuff in the trail of the wild
beast of the woodland tashtego now hunt in the wake of the great
whale of the sea the unerring harpoon of the son fitly replace the
infallible arrow of the sire to look at the tawny brawn of -PRON- lithe
snaky limb -PRON- would almost have credit the superstition of some of
the early puritans and half believe this wild indian to be a son
of the prince of the powers of the air tashtego be stubb the second
mate 's squire

third among the harpooneer be daggoo a gigantic coal black

life of the fishery in the ship of owner uncommonly heedful of what
manner of man -PRON- ship daggoo retain all -PRON- barbaric virtue
and erect as a giraffe move about the deck in all the pomp of six

beg truce of a fortress curious to tell this imperial negro ahasuerus
daggoo be the squire of little flask who look like a chess man
beside -PRON- as for the residue of the pequod 's company be -PRON- say that
at the present day not one in two of the many thousand man before the
mast employ in the american whale fishery be americans bear though
pretty nearly all the officer be herein -PRON- be the same with the
american whale fishery as with the american army and military and
merchant navy and the engineering force employ in the construction
of the american canals and railroad the same -PRON- say because in all
these case the native american liberally provide the brain the rest
of the world as generously supply the muscle no small number of
these whaling seaman belong to the azores where the outward bind
nantucket whaler frequently touch to augment -PRON- crew from the hardy
peasant of those rocky shore in like manner the greenland whaler
sail out of hull or london put in at the shetland islands to
receive the full complement of -PRON- crew upon the passage homeward

continent of man but each isolato live on a separate continent of -PRON-
own yet now federate along one keel what a set these isolatoes be
an anacharsis clootz deputation from all the isle of the sea and all

chapter 28 ahab


for several day after leave nantucket nothing above hatch be see
of captain ahab the mate regularly relieve each other at the watch
and for aught that could be see to the contrary -PRON- seem to be the
only commander of the ship only -PRON- sometimes issue from the cabin
with order so sudden and peremptory that after all -PRON- be plain -PRON-
but command vicariously yes -PRON- supreme lord and dictator be
there though hitherto unseen by any eye not permit to penetrate
into the now sacred retreat of the cabin

every time -PRON- ascend to the deck from -PRON- watch below -PRON- instantly
gaze aft to mark if any strange face be visible for -PRON- first vague
disquietude touch the unknown captain now in the seclusion of the
sea become almost a perturbation this be strangely heighten
at time by the ragged elijah 's diabolical incoherence uninvitedly
recur to -PRON- with a subtle energy -PRON- could not have before conceive
of but poorly could -PRON- withstand -PRON- much as in other mood -PRON- be
almost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicality of that outlandish
prophet of the wharf but whatev -PRON- be of apprehensiveness or
uneasiness to call -PRON- so which -PRON- feel yet whenever -PRON- come to look
about -PRON- in the ship -PRON- seem against all warrantry to cherish such
emotion for though the harpooneer with the great body of the crew
be a far more barbaric heathenish and motley set than any of the
tame merchant ship company which -PRON- previous experience have make -PRON-
acquaint with still -PRON- ascribe this and rightly ascribe -PRON- to the
fierce uniqueness of the very nature of that wild scandinavian vocation
in which -PRON- have so abandonedly embark but -PRON- be especially the aspect
of the three chief officer of the ship the mate which be most
forcibly calculate to allay these colourless misgiving and induce
confidence and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage three
good more likely sea officer and man each in -PRON- own different way
could not readily be find and -PRON- be every one of -PRON- americans a
nantucketer a vineyarder a cape man now -PRON- be christmas when the
ship shoot from out -PRON- harbor for a space -PRON- have bite polar weather
though all the time run away from -PRON- to the southward and by every
degree and minute of latitude which -PRON- sail gradually leave that
merciless winter and all -PRON- intolerable weather behind -PRON- -PRON- be one
of those less lowering but still grey and gloomy enough morning of the
transition when with a fair wind the ship be rush through the water
with a vindictive sort of leaping and melancholy rapidity that as -PRON-
mount to the deck at the call of the forenoon watch so soon as -PRON-
level -PRON- glance towards the taffrail forebode shiver run over -PRON-
reality outrun apprehension captain ahab stand upon -PRON- quarter deck

there seem no sign of common bodily illness about -PRON- nor of the
recovery from any -PRON- look like a man cut away from the stake when
the fire have overrunningly waste all the limb without consume -PRON-
or take away one particle from -PRON- compacted aged robustness -PRON-
whole high broad form seem make of solid bronze and shape in an
unalterable mould like cellini 's cast perseus thread -PRON- way out
from among -PRON- grey hair and continue right down one side of -PRON-
tawny scorch face and neck till -PRON- disappear in -PRON- clothing
-PRON- see a slender rod like mark lividly whitish -PRON- resemble that
perpendicular seam sometimes make in the straight lofty trunk of
a great tree when the upper lightning tearingly dart down -PRON- and
without wrench a single twig peel and groove out the bark from top
to bottom ere run off into the soil leave the tree still greenly
alive but brand whether that mark be bear with -PRON- or whether -PRON-
be the scar leave by some desperate wound no one could certainly say
by some tacit consent throughout the voyage little or no allusion be
make to -PRON- especially by the mate but once tashtego 's senior an old
gay head indian among the crew superstitiously assert that not till
-PRON- be full forty year old do ahab become that way brand and
then -PRON- come upon -PRON- not in the fury of any mortal fray but in
an elemental strife at sea yet this wild hint seem inferentially
negative by what a grey manxman insinuate an old sepulchral man
who have never before sail out of nantucket have never ere this
lay eye upon wild ahab nevertheless the old sea tradition the
immemorial credulity popularly invest this old manxman with
preternatural power of discernment so that no white sailor seriously
contradict -PRON- when -PRON- say that if ever captain ahab should
be tranquilly lay out which may hardly come to pass so -PRON-
mutter then whoever should do that last office for the dead would
find a birth mark on -PRON- from crown to sole

so powerfully do the whole grim aspect of ahab affect -PRON- and the livid
brand which streak -PRON- that for the first few moment -PRON- hardly note
that not a little of this overbearing grimness be owe to the barbaric
white leg upon which -PRON- partly stand -PRON- have previously come to -PRON- that
this ivory leg have at sea be fashion from the polished bone of
the sperm whale 's jaw aye -PRON- be dismast off japan say the old
gay head indian once but like -PRON- dismast craft -PRON- ship another
mast without come home for -PRON- -PRON- have a quiver of em

-PRON- be strike with the singular posture -PRON- maintain upon each side of
the pequod 's quarter deck and pretty close to the mizzen shroud there
be an auger hole bored about half an inch or so into the plank
-PRON- bone leg steady in that hole one arm elevate and holding by a
shroud captain ahab stand erect look straight out beyond the
ship 's ever pitch prow there be an infinity of firm fortitude
a determinate unsurrenderable wilfulness in the fixed and fearless
forward dedication of that glance not a word -PRON- speak nor do -PRON-
officer say aught to -PRON- though by all -PRON- minutest gesture
and expression -PRON- plainly show the uneasy if not painful
consciousness of be under a troubled master eye and not only that
but moody stricken ahab stand before -PRON- with a crucifixion in -PRON-
face in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of some mighty woe

ere long from -PRON- first visit in the air -PRON- withdraw into -PRON- cabin
but after that morning -PRON- be every day visible to the crew either
stand in -PRON- pivot hole or seat upon an ivory stool -PRON- have or
heavily walk the deck as the sky grow less gloomy indeed begin to
grow a little genial -PRON- become still less and less a recluse as
if when the ship have sail from home nothing but the dead wintry
bleakness of the sea have then keep -PRON- so secluded and by and by -PRON-
come to pass that -PRON- be almost continually in the air but as yet
for all that -PRON- say or perceptibly do on the at last sunny deck
-PRON- seem as unnecessary there as another mast but the pequod be
only make a passage now not regularly cruise nearly all whaling
preparatif need supervision the mate be fully competent to so
that there be little or nothing out of -PRON- to employ or excite
ahab now and thus chase away for that one interval the cloud that
layer upon layer be pile upon -PRON- brow as ever all cloud choose the
lofty peak to pile -PRON- upon

nevertheless ere long the warm warble persuasiveness of the
pleasant holiday weather -PRON- come to seem gradually to charm -PRON- from
-PRON- mood for as when the red cheeked dance girl april and may
trip home to the wintry misanthropic wood even the bare ruggedest
most thunder cleave old oak will at least send forth some few green
sprout to welcome such glad hearted visitant so ahab do in the
end a little respond to the playful alluring of that girlish air more
than once do -PRON- put forth the faint blossom of a look which in any
other man would have soon flower out in a smile



chapter 29 enter ahab to him stubb


some day elapse and ice and icebergs all astern the pequod now
go roll through the bright quito spring which at sea almost
perpetually reign on the threshold of the eternal august of the tropic
the warmly cool clear ring perfumed overflow redundant day
be as crystal goblet of persian sherbet heap up flake up with
rise water snow the starred and stately night seem haughty dame in
jewelled velvet nursing at home in lonely pride the memory of -PRON-
absent conquer earls the golden helmeted sun for sleep man
twas hard to choose between such winsome day and such seducing night
but all the witchery of that unwan weather do not merely lend new
spell and potency to the outward world inward -PRON- turn upon the
soul especially when the still mild hour of eve come on then memory
shoot -PRON- crystal as the clear ice most form of noiseless twilight
and all these subtle agency more and more -PRON- work on ahab 's
texture

old age be always wakeful as if the longer link with life the less
man have to do with aught that look like death among sea commander
the old greybeard will oftenest leave -PRON- berth to visit the
night cloak deck -PRON- be so with ahab only that now of late -PRON-
seem so much to live in the open air that truly speak -PRON- visit
be more to the cabin than from the cabin to the plank -PRON- feel
like go down into one 's tomb -PRON- would mutter to himself--"for an
old captain like -PRON- to be descend this narrow scuttle to go to -PRON-
grave dug berth

so almost every twenty four hour when the watch of the night be
set and the band on deck sentinell the slumber of the band below
and when if a rope be to be haul upon the forecastle the sailor
fling -PRON- not rudely down as by day but with some cautiousness dropt
-PRON- to -PRON- place for fear of disturb -PRON- slumbering shipmate when
this sort of steady quietude would begin to prevail habitually the
silent steersman would watch the cabin scuttle and ere long the old man
would emerge grip at the iron banister to help -PRON- crippled way
some consider touch of humanity be in -PRON- for at time like these
-PRON- usually abstain from patrol the quarter deck because to -PRON-
wearied mate seek repose within six inch of -PRON- ivory heel such
would have be the reverberating crack and din of that bony step that
-PRON- dream would have be on the crunching tooth of shark but once
the mood be on -PRON- too deep for common regarding and as with heavy
lumber like pace -PRON- be measure the ship from taffrail to mainmast
stubb the old second mate come up from below with a certain
unassured deprecate humorousness hint that if captain ahab be
pleased to walk the plank then no one could say nay but there may
be some way of muffle the noise hint something indistinctly and
hesitatingly about a globe of tow and the insertion into -PRON- of the
ivory heel ah stubb thou didst not know ahab then

be -PRON- a cannon ball stubb say ahab that thou wouldst wad -PRON- that
fashion but go thy way -PRON- have forget below to thy nightly grave
where such as ye sleep between shroud to use ye to the fill one at
last down dog and kennel

start at the unforseen conclude exclamation of the so suddenly
scornful old man stubb be speechless a moment then say excitedly -PRON-
be not use to be speak to that way sir -PRON- do but less than half like
-PRON- sir

avast grit ahab between -PRON- set tooth and violently move away
as if to avoid some passionate temptation

no sir not yet say stubb embolden -PRON- will not tamely be call
a dog sir

then be call ten time a donkey and a mule and an ass and begone
or -PRON- will clear the world of thee

as -PRON- say this ahab advance upon -PRON- with such overbearing terror in
-PRON- aspect that stubb involuntarily retreat

-PRON- be never serve so before without give a hard blow for -PRON-
mutter stubb as -PRON- find -PRON- descend the cabin scuttle -PRON- be
very queer stop stubb somehow now -PRON- do not well know whether to go
back and strike -PRON- or what be that down here on -PRON- knee and pray
for -PRON- yes that be the thought come up in -PRON- but -PRON- would be the
first time -PRON- ever do pray -PRON- be queer very queer and -PRON- be queer too
aye take -PRON- fore and aft -PRON- be about the queer old man stubb ever
sail with how -PRON- flash at me!--his eye like powder pan be -PRON-
mad anyway there be something on -PRON- mind as sure as there must be
something on a deck when -PRON- crack -PRON- be not in -PRON- bed now either more
than three hour out of the twenty four and -PRON- do not sleep then do not
that dough boy the steward tell -PRON- that of a morning -PRON- always find
the old man 's hammock clothe all rumpled and tumble and the sheet
down at the foot and the coverlid almost tie into knot and the
pillow a sort of frightful hot as though a baked brick have be on
-PRON- a hot old man -PRON- gues -PRON- be get what some folk ashore call
a conscience -PRON- be a kind of tic dolly row -PRON- say bad nor a
toothache well well -PRON- do not know what -PRON- be but the lord keep -PRON-
from catch -PRON- -PRON- be full of riddle -PRON- wonder what -PRON- go into the
after hold for every night as dough boy tell -PRON- -PRON- suspect what be
that for -PRON- should like to know who be make appointment with -PRON- in
the hold be not that queer now but there be no telling -PRON- be the old
game here go for a snooze damn -PRON- -PRON- be worth a fellow 's while to be
bear into the world if only to fall right asleep and now that -PRON- think
of -PRON- that be about the first thing baby do and that be a sort of
queer too damn -PRON- but all thing be queer come to think of 'em but
that be against -PRON- principle think not be -PRON- eleventh commandment and
sleep when -PRON- can be -PRON- twelfth so here go again but how be that
do not -PRON- call -PRON- a dog blaze -PRON- call -PRON- ten time a donkey and
pile a lot of jackass on top of that -PRON- may as well have kick
-PRON- and do with -PRON- maybe -PRON- do kick -PRON- and -PRON- do not observe -PRON-
-PRON- be so take all aback with -PRON- brow somehow -PRON- flash like a
bleach bone what the devil be the matter with -PRON- -PRON- do not stand right
on -PRON- leg come afoul of that old man have a sort of turn -PRON- wrong
side out by the lord -PRON- must have be dream though how how
how but the only way 's to stash -PRON- so here go to hammock again
and in the morning -PRON- will see how this plaguey juggle think over by
daylight



chapter 30 the pipe


when stubb have depart ahab stand for a while lean over the
bulwark and then as have be usual with -PRON- of late call a sailor
of the watch -PRON- send -PRON- below for -PRON- ivory stool and also -PRON- pipe
light the pipe at the binnacle lamp and plant the stool on the
weather side of the deck -PRON- sit and smoke

in old norse time the throne of the sea love danish king be
fabricate saith tradition of the tusk of the narwhale how could one
look at ahab then seat on that tripod of bone without bethink
-PRON- of the royalty -PRON- symbolize for a khan of the plank and a king of
the sea and a great lord of leviathans be ahab

some moment pass during which the thick vapour come from -PRON- mouth
in quick and constant puff which blow back again into -PRON- face how
now -PRON- soliloquize at last withdraw the tube this smoking no
longer soothe oh -PRON- pipe hard must -PRON- go with -PRON- if thy charm be
go here have -PRON- be unconsciously toil not pleasur aye and
ignorantly smoking to windward all the while to windward and with
such nervous whiff as if like the die whale -PRON- final jet be the
strong and full of trouble what business have -PRON- with this pipe
this thing that be mean for sereneness to send up mild white vapour
among mild white hair not among torn iron grey lock like mine -PRON- will
smoke no more--

-PRON- toss the still light pipe into the sea the fire hiss in the
wave the same instant the ship shoot by the bubble the sink pipe
make with slouch hat ahab lurchingly pace the plank

chapter 32 cetology


already -PRON- be boldly launch upon the deep but soon -PRON- shall be lose
in -PRON- unshored harbourless immensity ere that come to pass ere the
pequod 's weedy hull roll side by side with the barnacled hull of the
leviathan at the outset -PRON- be but well to attend to a matter almost
indispensable to a thorough appreciative understanding of the more
special leviathanic revelation and allusion of all sort which be to
follow

-PRON- be some systematized exhibition of the whale in -PRON- broad genera
that -PRON- would now fain put before -PRON- yet be -PRON- no easy task the
classification of the constituent of a chaos nothing less be here
essay listen to what the good and late authority have lay down

no branch of zoology be so much involve as that which be entitled
cetology say captain scoresby a.d. 1820

-PRON- be not -PRON- intention be -PRON- in -PRON- power to enter into the
inquiry as to the true method of divide the cetacea into group and
family utter confusion exist among the historian of this animal
sperm whale say surgeon beale a.d. 1839

unfitness to pursue -PRON- research in the unfathomable water
impenetrable veil cover -PRON- knowledge of the cetacea a field
strew with thorn all these incomplete indication but serve to
torture -PRON- naturalist

thus speak of the whale the great cuvier and john hunter and lesson
those light of zoology and anatomy nevertheless though of real
knowledge there be little yet of book there be a plenty and so in
some small degree with cetology or the science of whale many be
the man small and great old and new landsman and seaman who have at
large or in little write of the whale run over a few the authors
of the bible aristotle pliny aldrovandi sir thomas browne gesner
ray linnaeus rondeletius willoughby green artedi sibbald brisson
marten lacepede bonneterre desmarest baron cuvier frederick cuvier
john hunter owen scoresby beale bennett j. ross browne the
author of miriam coffin olmstead and the rev. t. cheever but to what
ultimate generalizing purpose all these have write the above cite
extract will show

of the name in this list of whale author only those follow owen
ever see live whale and but one of -PRON- be a real professional
harpooneer and whaleman -PRON- mean captain scoresby on the separate
subject of the greenland or right whale -PRON- be the good exist
authority but scoresby know nothing and say nothing of the great
sperm whale compare with which the greenland whale be almost unworthy
mention and here be -PRON- say that the greenland whale be an usurper
upon the throne of the sea -PRON- be not even by any mean the large
of the whale yet owe to the long priority of -PRON- claim and the
profound ignorance which till some seventy year back invest the
then fabulous or utterly unknown sperm whale and which ignorance to
this present day still reign in all but some few scientific retreat
and whale port this usurpation have be every way complete reference
to nearly all the leviathanic allusion in the great poet of past day
will satisfy -PRON- that the greenland whale without one rival be to
-PRON- the monarch of the sea but the time have at last come for a new
proclamation this be charing cross hear ye good people all the
greenland whale be depose the great sperm whale now reigneth

there be only two book in be which at all pretend to put the living
sperm whale before -PRON- and at the same time in the remotest degree
succeed in the attempt those book be beale 's and bennett 's both in
-PRON- time surgeon to english south sea whale ship and both exact and
reliable man the original matter touch the sperm whale to be find
in -PRON- volume be necessarily small but so far as -PRON- go -PRON- be of
excellent quality though mostly confine to scientific description as
yet however the sperm whale scientific or poetic live not complete
in any literature far above all other hunt whale -PRON- be an
unwritten life

now the various specie of whale ne some sort of popular
comprehensive classification if only an easy outline one for the
present hereafter to be fill in all -PRON- department by subsequent
laborer as no good man advance to take this matter in hand -PRON-
hereupon offer -PRON- own poor endeavor -PRON- promise nothing complete
because any human thing suppose to be complete must for that very
reason infallibly be faulty -PRON- shall not pretend to a minute anatomical
description of the various specie or in this place at least to much
of any description -PRON- object here be simply to project the draught of a
systematization of cetology -PRON- be the architect not the builder

but -PRON- be a ponderous task no ordinary letter sorter in the post office
be equal to -PRON- to grope down into the bottom of the sea after -PRON-
to have one 's hand among the unspeakable foundation rib and very
pelvis of the world this be a fearful thing what be -PRON- that -PRON- should
essay to hook the nose of this leviathan the awful taunting in job
may well appal -PRON- will -PRON- the leviathan make a covenant with thee
behold the hope of -PRON- be vain but -PRON- have swim through library and
sail through ocean -PRON- have have to do with whale with these visible
hand -PRON- be in earnest and -PRON- will try there be some preliminary to
settle

first the uncertain unsettled condition of this science of cetology
be in the very vestibule attest by the fact that in some quarter -PRON-
still remain a moot point whether a whale be a fish in -PRON- system of
nature a.d. 1776 linnaeus declare -PRON- hereby separate the whale from
the fish but of -PRON- own knowledge -PRON- know that down to the year 1850
shark and shad alewife and herring against linnaeus 's express edict
be still find divide the possession of the same sea with the
leviathan

the ground upon which linnaeus would fain have banish the whale from
the water -PRON- state as follow on account of -PRON- warm bilocular
heart -PRON- lung -PRON- movable eyelid -PRON- hollow ear penem
intrantem feminam mammis lactantem and finally ex lege naturae jure
meritoque -PRON- submit all this to -PRON- friend simeon macey and charley
coffin of nantucket both messmate of mine in a certain voyage and
-PRON- unite in the opinion that the reason set forth be altogether
insufficient charley profanely hint -PRON- be humbug

be -PRON- know that waive all argument -PRON- take the good old fashion
ground that the whale be a fish and call upon holy jonah to back -PRON-
this fundamental thing settle the next point be in what internal
respect do the whale differ from other fish above linnaeus have give
-PRON- those item but in brief -PRON- be these lung and warm blood
whereas all other fish be lungless and cold blooded

next how shall -PRON- define the whale by -PRON- obvious external so as
conspicuously to label -PRON- for all time to come to be short then a
whale be a spout fish with a horizontal tail there -PRON- have
-PRON- however contract that definition be the result of expand
meditation a walrus spout much like a whale but the walrus be not a
fish because -PRON- be amphibious but the last term of the definition be
still more cogent as couple with the first almost any one must have
notice that all the fish familiar to landsman have not a flat but a
vertical or up and down tail whereas among spout fish the tail
though -PRON- may be similarly shape invariably assume a horizontal
position

by the above definition of what a whale be -PRON- do by no mean exclude
from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identify
with the whale by the good informed nantucketers nor on the other
hand link with -PRON- any fish hitherto authoritatively regard as alien
hence all the small spout and horizontal tailed fish must be
include in this ground plan of cetology now then come the grand
division of the entire whale host


-PRON- be aware that down to the present time the fish style lamatins and
dugong pig fish and sow fish of the coffin of nantucket be include
by many naturalist among the whale but as these pig fish be a noisy
contemptible set mostly lurk in the mouth of river and feed on
wet hay and especially as -PRON- do not spout -PRON- deny -PRON- credential
as whale and have present -PRON- with -PRON- passport to quit the
kingdom of cetology


first accord to magnitude -PRON- divide the whale into three primary
book subdivisible into chapters and these shall comprehend -PRON- all
both small and large

i. the folio whale ii the octavo whale iii the duodecimo whale

as the type of the folio -PRON- present the sperm whale of the octavo the
grampus of the duodecimo the porpoise

folios among these -PRON- here include the follow chapter i. the sperm
whale ii the right whale iii the fin back whale iv the hump backed
whale v. the razor back whale vi the sulphur bottom whale

book i. folio chapter i. sperm whale).--this whale among the
english of old vaguely know as the trumpa whale and the physeter
whale and the anvil headed whale be the present cachalot of the
french and the pottsfich of the germans and the macrocephalus of the
long word -PRON- be without doubt the large inhabitant of the globe
the most formidable of all whale to encounter the most majestic in
aspect and lastly by far the most valuable in commerce -PRON- be
the only creature from which that valuable substance spermaceti be
obtain all -PRON- peculiarity will in many other place be enlarge
upon -PRON- be chiefly with -PRON- name that -PRON- now have to do philologically
consider -PRON- be absurd some century ago when the sperm whale be
almost wholly unknown in -PRON- own proper individuality and when -PRON- oil
be only accidentally obtain from the stranded fish in those day
spermaceti -PRON- would seem be popularly suppose to be derive from a
creature identical with the one then know in england as the greenland
or right whale -PRON- be the idea also that this same spermaceti be that
quicken humor of the greenland whale which the first syllable of
the word literally express in those time also spermaceti be
exceedingly scarce not be use for light but only as an ointment
and medicament -PRON- be only to be have from the druggist as -PRON- nowadays
buy an ounce of rhubarb when as -PRON- opine in the course of time the
true nature of spermaceti become know -PRON- original name be still
retain by the dealer no doubt to enhance -PRON- value by a notion so
strangely significant of -PRON- scarcity and so the appellation must at
last have come to be bestow upon the whale from which this spermaceti
be really derive

book i. folio chapter ii right whale).--in one respect this be the
most venerable of the leviathan be the one first regularly hunt
by man -PRON- yield the article commonly know as whalebone or baleen and
the oil specially know as whale oil an inferior article in commerce
among the fisherman -PRON- be indiscriminately designate by all the
follow title the whale the greenland whale the black whale
the great whale the true whale the right whale there be a deal of
obscurity concern the identity of the specie thus multitudinously
baptise what then be the whale which -PRON- include in the second specie
of -PRON- folio -PRON- be the great mysticetus of the english naturalist the
greenland whale of the english whaleman the baleine ordinaire of the
french whaleman the growlands walfish of the swedes -PRON- be the whale
which for more than two century past have be hunt by the dutch and
english in the arctic seas -PRON- be the whale which the american fisherman
have long pursue in the indian ocean on the brazil banks on the nor
west coast and various other part of the world designate by -PRON-
right whale cruising grounds

some pretend to see a difference between the greenland whale of the
english and the right whale of the americans but -PRON- precisely agree
in all -PRON- grand feature nor have there yet be present a single
determinate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction -PRON- be by
endless subdivision base upon the most inconclusive difference that
some department of natural history become so repellingly intricate the
right whale will be elsewhere treat of at some length with reference
to elucidate the sperm whale

book i. folio chapter iii fin back).--under this head -PRON- reckon
a monster which by the various name of fin back tall spout and
long john have be see almost in every sea and be commonly the whale
whose distant jet be so often descry by passenger cross the
atlantic in the new york packet track in the length -PRON- attain and
in -PRON- baleen the fin back resemble the right whale but be of a less
portly girth and a light colour approach to olive -PRON- great lip
present a cable like aspect form by the intertwisting slant fold
of large wrinkle -PRON- grand distinguishing feature the fin from which
-PRON- derive -PRON- name be often a conspicuous object this fin be some
three or four foot long grow vertically from the hinder part of the
back of an angular shape and with a very sharp pointed end even if
not the slight other part of the creature be visible this isolated
fin will at time be see plainly project from the surface when
the sea be moderately calm and slightly mark with spherical ripple
and this gnomon like fin stand up and cast shadow upon the wrinkled
surface -PRON- may well be suppose that the watery circle surround -PRON-
somewhat resemble a dial with -PRON- style and wavy hour line grave on
-PRON- on that ahaz dial the shadow often go back the fin back be not
gregarious -PRON- seem a whale hater as some man be man hater very
shy always go solitary unexpectedly rise to the surface in the
remotest and most sullen water -PRON- straight and single lofty jet
rise like a tall misanthropic spear upon a barren plain gifted with
such wondrous power and velocity in swimming as to defy all present
pursuit from man this leviathan seem the banish and unconquerable
cain of -PRON- race bear for -PRON- mark that style upon -PRON- back from
have the baleen in -PRON- mouth the fin back be sometimes include with
the right whale among a theoretic specie denominate whalebone whales
that be whale with baleen of these so call whalebone whale there
would seem to be several variety most of which however be little
know broad nosed whale and beak whale pike head whale bunch
whale under jaw whale and rostrat whale be the fisherman 's
name for a few sort

in connection with this appellative of whalebone whale -PRON- be of
great importance to mention that however such a nomenclature may be
convenient in facilitate allusion to some kind of whale yet -PRON- be
in vain to attempt a clear classification of the leviathan found upon
either -PRON- baleen or hump or fin or tooth notwithstand that those
marked part or feature very obviously seem better adapt to afford
the basis for a regular system of cetology than any other detach
bodily distinction which the whale in -PRON- kind present how
then the baleen hump back fin and tooth these be thing whose
peculiarity be indiscriminately disperse among all sort of whale
without any regard to what may be the nature of -PRON- structure in other
and more essential particular thus the sperm whale and the humpbacked
whale each have a hump but there the similitude cease then this same
humpbacked whale and the greenland whale each of these have baleen
but there again the similitude cease and -PRON- be just the same with the
other part above mention in various sort of whale -PRON- form such
irregular combination or in the case of any one of -PRON- detach
such an irregular isolation as utterly to defy all general
methodization form upon such a basis on this rock every one of the
whale naturalist have split

but -PRON- may possibly be conceive that in the internal part of the
whale in -PRON- anatomy there at least -PRON- shall be able to hit the
right classification nay what thing for example be there in the
greenland whale 's anatomy more striking than -PRON- baleen yet -PRON- have
see that by -PRON- baleen -PRON- be impossible correctly to classify the
greenland whale and if -PRON- descend into the bowel of the various
leviathan why there -PRON- will not find distinction a fiftieth part as
available to the systematizer as those external one already enumerate
what then remain nothing but to take hold of the whale bodily in
-PRON- entire liberal volume and boldly sort -PRON- that way and this be
the bibliographical system here adopt and -PRON- be the only one that can
possibly succeed for -PRON- alone be practicable to proceed

book i. folio chapter iv hump back).--this whale be often see on
the northern american coast -PRON- have be frequently capture there and
tow into harbor -PRON- have a great pack on -PRON- like a peddler or -PRON-
may call -PRON- the elephant and castle whale at any rate the popular
name for -PRON- do not sufficiently distinguish -PRON- since the sperm
whale also have a hump though a small one -PRON- oil be not very
valuable -PRON- have baleen -PRON- be the most gamesome and light hearted of
all the whale make more gay foam and white water generally than any
other of -PRON-

book i. folio chapter v. razor back).--of this whale little be know
but -PRON- name -PRON- have see -PRON- at a distance off cape horn of a retire
nature -PRON- elude both hunter and philosopher though no coward -PRON-
have never yet show any part of -PRON- but -PRON- back which rise in a long
sharp ridge let -PRON- go -PRON- know little more of -PRON- nor do anybody
else

book i. folio chapter vi sulphur bottom).--another retire
gentleman with a brimstone belly doubtless get by scrap along the
tartarian tile in some of -PRON- profounder diving -PRON- be seldom see
at least -PRON- have never see -PRON- except in the remoter southern sea
and then always at too great a distance to study -PRON- countenance -PRON- be
never chase -PRON- would run away with rope walk of line prodigy be
tell of -PRON- adieu sulphur bottom -PRON- can say nothing more that be true
of ye nor can the old nantucketer

thus end book i. folio and now begin book ii octavo

octavoes.*--these embrace the whale of middling magnitude among which
present may be number i. the grampus ii the black fish iii
the narwhale iv the thrasher v. the killer


why this book of whale be not denominate the quarto be very plain
because while the whale of this order though small than those of
the former order nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to -PRON-
in figure yet the bookbinder 's quarto volume in -PRON- dimension form
do not preserve the shape of the folio volume but the octavo volume
do


book ii octavo chapter i. grampus).--though this fish whose
loud sonorous breathing or rather blow have furnish a proverb
to landsman be so well know a denizen of the deep yet be -PRON- not
popularly class among whale but possess all the grand distinctive
feature of the leviathan most naturalist have recognise -PRON- for one
-PRON- be of moderate octavo size vary from fifteen to twenty five foot
in length and of correspond dimension round the waist -PRON- swim in
herd -PRON- be never regularly hunt though -PRON- oil be considerable in
quantity and pretty good for light by some fishermen -PRON- approach be
regard as premonitory of the advance of the great sperm whale

book ii octavo chapter ii black fish).--i give the popular
fisherman 's name for all these fish for generally -PRON- be the good
where any name happen to be vague or inexpressive -PRON- shall say so
and suggest another -PRON- do so now touch the black fish so call
because blackness be the rule among almost all whale so call -PRON- the
hyena whale if -PRON- please -PRON- voracity be well know and from the
circumstance that the inner angle of -PRON- lip be curved upward -PRON-
carry an everlasting mephistophelean grin on -PRON- face this whale
average some sixteen or eighteen foot in length -PRON- be find in almost
all latitude -PRON- have a peculiar way of show -PRON- dorsal hooked fin
in swimming which look something like a roman nose when not more
profitably employ the sperm whale hunter sometimes capture the hyena
whale to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic employment as
some frugal housekeeper in the absence of company and quite alone by
-PRON- burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax though -PRON-
blubber be very thin some of these whale will yield -PRON- upward of
thirty gallon of oil

book ii octavo chapter iii narwhale that is nostril
whale another instance of a curiously name whale so name -PRON- suppose
from -PRON- peculiar horn be originally mistake for a peaked nose the
creature be some sixteen foot in length while -PRON- horn average five
foot though some exce ten and even attain to fifteen foot strictly
speak this horn be but a lengthened tusk grow out from the jaw
in a line a little depressed from the horizontal but -PRON- be only
find on the sinister side which have an ill effect give -PRON- owner
something analogous to the aspect of a clumsy leave handed man what
precise purpose this ivory horn or lance answer -PRON- would be hard to
say -PRON- do not seem to be use like the blade of the sword fish and
bill fish though some sailor tell -PRON- that the narwhale employ -PRON- for
a rake in turn over the bottom of the sea for food charley coffin
say -PRON- be use for an ice piercer for the narwhale rise to the
surface of the polar sea and find -PRON- sheet with ice thrust -PRON-
horn up and so break through but -PRON- can not prove either of these
surmise to be correct -PRON- own opinion be that however this one sided
horn may really be use by the narwhale however that may be -PRON- would
certainly be very convenient to -PRON- for a folder in read pamphlet
the narwhale -PRON- have hear call the tusked whale the horned whale and
the unicorn whale -PRON- be certainly a curious example of the unicornism
to be find in almost every kingdom of animated nature from certain
cloistered old author -PRON- have gather that this same sea unicorn 's horn
be in ancient day regard as the great antidote against poison
and as such preparation of -PRON- bring immense price -PRON- be also
distil to a volatile salt for faint lady the same way that the
horn of the male deer be manufacture into hartshorn originally -PRON-
be in -PRON- account an object of great curiosity black letter tell
-PRON- that sir martin frobisher on -PRON- return from that voyage when
queen bess do gallantly wave -PRON- jewelled hand to -PRON- from a window
of greenwich palace as -PRON- bold ship sail down the thames when sir
martin return from that voyage saith black letter on bended knee
-PRON- present to -PRON- highness a prodigious long horn of the narwhale
which for a long period after hung in the castle at windsor an irish
author aver that the earl of leicester on bended knee do likewise
present to -PRON- highness another horn pertain to a land beast of the
unicorn nature

the narwhale have a very picturesque leopard like look being of a
milk white ground colour dot with round and oblong spot of black
-PRON- oil be very superior clear and fine but there be little of -PRON- and
-PRON- be seldom hunt -PRON- be mostly find in the circumpolar sea

book ii octavo chapter iv killer).--of this whale little be
precisely know to the nantucketer and nothing at all to the profess
naturalist from what -PRON- have see of -PRON- at a distance -PRON- should say
that -PRON- be about the bigness of a grampus -PRON- be very savage a sort of
feegee fish -PRON- sometimes take the great folio whale by the lip and
hang there like a leech till the mighty brute be worry to death the
killer be never hunt -PRON- never hear what sort of oil -PRON- have exception
may be take to the name bestow upon this whale on the ground
of -PRON- indistinctness for -PRON- be all killer on land and on sea
bonaparte and sharks include

book ii octavo chapter v. thrasher).--this gentleman be famous for
-PRON- tail which -PRON- use for a ferule in thrash -PRON- foe -PRON- mount
the folio whale 's back and as -PRON- swim -PRON- work -PRON- passage by
flog -PRON- as some schoolmaster get along in the world by a similar
process still less be know of the thrasher than of the killer both
be outlaw even in the lawless sea

thus end book ii octavo and begin book iii duodecimo

duodecimoe these include the small whale i. the huzza porpoise
ii the algerine porpoise iii the mealy mouth porpoise

to those who have not chance specially to study the subject -PRON- may
possibly seem strange that fish not commonly exceed four or five
foot should be marshal among whale a word which in the popular
sense always convey an idea of hugeness but the creature set
down above as duodecimoes be infallibly whale by the term of -PRON-
definition of what a whale be i.e a spout fish with a horizontal
tail

book iii duodecimo chapter 1 huzza porpoise).--this be the
common porpoise find almost all over the globe the name be of -PRON- own
bestowal for there be more than one sort of porpoise and something
must be do to distinguish -PRON- -PRON- call -PRON- thus because -PRON- always
swim in hilarious shoal which upon the broad sea keep toss
-PRON- to heaven like cap in a fourth of july crowd -PRON-
appearance be generally hail with delight by the mariner full of fine
spirit -PRON- invariably come from the breezy billow to windward -PRON-
be the lad that always live before the wind -PRON- be account a
lucky omen if -PRON- -PRON- can withstand three cheer at behold
these vivacious fish then heaven help ye the spirit of godly
gamesomeness be not in ye a well feed plump huzza porpoise will
yield -PRON- one good gallon of good oil but the fine and delicate fluid
extract from -PRON- jaws be exceedingly valuable -PRON- be in request among
jeweller and watchmaker sailor put -PRON- on -PRON- hone porpoise
meat be good eating -PRON- know -PRON- may never have occur to -PRON- that
a porpoise spout indeed -PRON- spout be so small that -PRON- be not very
readily discernible but the next time -PRON- have a chance watch -PRON- and
-PRON- will then see the great sperm whale -PRON- in miniature

book iii duodecimo chapter ii algerine porpoise).--a pirate very
savage -PRON- be only find -PRON- think in the pacific -PRON- be somewhat large
than the huzza porpoise but much of the same general make provoke -PRON-
and -PRON- will buckle to a shark -PRON- have lower for -PRON- many time but
never yet see -PRON- capture

book iii duodecimo chapter iii mealy mouthed porpoise).--the
large kind of porpoise and only find in the pacific so far as -PRON- be
know the only english name by which -PRON- have hitherto be designate
be that of the fisher right whale porpoise from the circumstance that
-PRON- be chiefly find in the vicinity of that folio in shape -PRON- differ
in some degree from the huzza porpoise being of a less rotund and jolly
girth indeed -PRON- be of quite a neat and gentleman like figure -PRON- have
no fin on -PRON- back most other porpoise have -PRON- have a lovely tail
and sentimental indian eye of a hazel hue but -PRON- mealy mouth spoil
all though -PRON- entire back down to -PRON- side fin be of a deep sable
yet a boundary line distinct as the mark in a ship 's hull call
the bright waist that line streak -PRON- from stem to stern with two
separate colour black above and white below the white comprise part
of -PRON- head and the whole of -PRON- mouth which make -PRON- look as if -PRON-
have just escape from a felonious visit to a meal bag a most mean and
mealy aspect -PRON- oil be much like that of the common porpoise


beyond the duodecimo this system do not proceed inasmuch as
the porpoise be the small of the whale above -PRON- have all the
leviathans of note but there be a rabble of uncertain fugitive
half fabulous whale which as an american whaleman -PRON- know by
reputation but not personally -PRON- shall enumerate -PRON- by -PRON-
fore castle appellation for possibly such a list may be valuable to
future investigator who may complete what -PRON- have here but begin if
any of the follow whale shall hereafter be catch and mark then
-PRON- can readily be incorporate into this system accord to -PRON- folio
octavo or duodecimo magnitude the bottle nose whale the junk whale
the pudding head whale the cape whale the leading whale the cannon
whale the scragg whale the coppered whale the elephant whale the
iceberg whale the quog whale the blue whale etc from icelandic
dutch and old english authority there may be quote other list of
uncertain whale bless with all manner of uncouth name but -PRON- omit
-PRON- as altogether obsolete and can hardly help suspect -PRON- for
mere sound full of leviathanism but signify nothing

finally -PRON- be state at the outset that this system would not be
here and at once perfect -PRON- can not but plainly see that -PRON- have
keep -PRON- word but -PRON- now leave -PRON- cetological system stand thus
unfinished even as the great cathedral of cologne be leave with the
crane still stand upon the top of the uncompleted tower for small
erection may be finish by -PRON- first architect grand one true
one ever leave the copestone to posterity god keep -PRON- from ever
complete anything this whole book be but a draught nay but the
draught of a draught oh time strength cash and patience



chapter 33 the specksynder


concern the officer of the whale craft this seem as good a place
as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship board arise
from the existence of the harpooneer class of officer a class unknown
of course in any other marine than the whale fleet

the large importance attach to the harpooneer 's vocation be evince
by the fact that originally in the old dutch fishery two century
and more ago the command of a whale ship be not wholly lodge in
the person now call the captain but be divide between -PRON- and an
officer call the specksynder literally this word mean fat cutter
usage however in time make -PRON- equivalent to chief harpooneer in
those day the captain 's authority be restrict to the navigation
and general management of the vessel while over the whale hunt
department and all -PRON- concern the specksynder or chief harpooneer
reign supreme in the british greenland fishery under the corrupt
title of specksioneer this old dutch official be still retain but
-PRON- former dignity be sadly abridge at present -PRON- rank simply
as senior harpooneer and as such be but one of the captain 's more
inferior subaltern nevertheless as upon the good conduct of the
harpooneer the success of a whaling voyage largely depend and since
in the american fishery -PRON- be not only an important officer in the boat
but under certain circumstance night watch on a whaling ground the
command of the ship 's deck be also -PRON- therefore the grand political
maxim of the sea demand that -PRON- should nominally live apart from
the man before the mast and be in some way distinguished as -PRON-
professional superior though always by -PRON- familiarly regard as
-PRON- social equal

now the grand distinction draw between officer and man at sea be
this the first live aft the last forward hence in whale ship and
merchantman alike the mate have -PRON- quarter with the captain and
so too in most of the american whaler the harpooneer be lodge in
the after part of the ship that be to say -PRON- take -PRON- meal in the
captain 's cabin and sleep in a place indirectly communicate with -PRON-

though the long period of a southern whaling voyage by far the long
of all voyage now or ever make by man the peculiar peril of -PRON- and
the community of interest prevail among a company all of whom high
or low depend for -PRON- profit not upon fix wage but upon -PRON-
common luck together with -PRON- common vigilance intrepidity and
hard work though all these thing do in some case tend to beget a less
rigorous discipline than in merchantman generally yet never mind
how much like an old mesopotamian family these whaleman may in some
primitive instance live together for all that the punctilious
external at least of the quarter deck be seldom materially relaxed
and in no instance do away indeed many be the nantucket ship in
which -PRON- will see the skipper parade -PRON- quarter deck with an elated
grandeur not surpass in any military navy nay extort almost
as much outward homage as if -PRON- wear the imperial purple and not the
shabbiest of pilot cloth

and though of all man the moody captain of the pequod be the least
give to that sort of shallowest assumption and though the only homage
-PRON- ever exact be implicit instantaneous obedience though -PRON-
require no man to remove the shoe from -PRON- foot ere step upon
the quarter deck and though there be time when owe to peculiar
circumstance connected with event hereafter to be detail -PRON-
address -PRON- in unusual term whether of condescension or in
terrorem or otherwise yet even captain ahab be by no mean
unobservant of the paramount form and usage of the sea

nor perhaps will -PRON- fail to be eventually perceive that behind those
form and usage as -PRON- be -PRON- sometimes mask -PRON- incidentally
make use of -PRON- for other and more private end than -PRON- be
legitimately intend to subserve that certain sultanism of -PRON- brain
which have otherwise in a good degree remain unmanifested through
those form that same sultanism become incarnate in an irresistible
dictatorship for be a man 's intellectual superiority what -PRON- will
-PRON- can never assume the practical available supremacy over other man
without the aid of some sort of external art and entrenchment always
in -PRON- more or less paltry and base this -PRON- be that for ever
keep god 's true prince of the empire from the world 's husting and
leave the high honour that this air can give to those man who
become famous more through -PRON- infinite inferiority to the choice
hidden handful of the divine inert than through -PRON- undoubted
superiority over the dead level of the mass such large virtue lurk
in these small thing when extreme political superstition invest -PRON-
that in some royal instance even to idiot imbecility -PRON- have impart
potency but when as in the case of nicholas the czar the ring crown
of geographical empire encircle an imperial brain then the plebeian
herd crouch abase before the tremendous centralization nor will the
tragic dramatist who would depict mortal indomitableness in -PRON- full
sweep and direct swing ever forget a hint incidentally so important in
-PRON- art as the one now allude to

but ahab -PRON- captain still move before -PRON- in all -PRON- nantucket
grimness and shagginess and in this episode touch emperor and
king -PRON- must not conceal that -PRON- have only to do with a poor old
whale hunter like -PRON- and therefore all outward majestical trapping
and housing be deny -PRON- oh ahab what shall be grand in thee -PRON-
must need be pluck at from the sky and dive for in the deep and
feature in the unbodied air



chapter 34 the cabin table


-PRON- be noon and dough boy the steward thrust -PRON- pale loaf of bread
face from the cabin scuttle announce dinner to -PRON- lord and
master who sit in the lee quarter boat have just be take an
observation of the sun and be now mutely reckon the latitude on the
smooth medallion shape tablet reserve for that daily purpose on
the upper part of -PRON- ivory leg from -PRON- complete inattention to the
tiding -PRON- would think that moody ahab have not hear -PRON- menial but
presently catch hold of the mizen shroud -PRON- swing -PRON- to
the deck and in an even unexhilarated voice say dinner mr.
starbuck disappear into the cabin

when the last echo of -PRON- sultan 's step have die away and starbuck the
first emir have every reason to suppose that -PRON- be seat then starbuck
rouse from -PRON- quietude take a few turn along the plank and after
a grave peep into the binnacle say with some touch of pleasantness
dinner mr. stubb and descend the scuttle the second emir lounge
about the rig awhile and then slightly shake the main brace to
see whether -PRON- will be all right with that important rope -PRON- likewise
take up the old burden and with a rapid dinner mr. flask follow
after -PRON- predecessor

but the third emir now see -PRON- all alone on the quarter deck
seem to feel relieved from some curious restraint for tip all
sort of know wink in all sort of direction and kick off -PRON-
shoe -PRON- strike into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right
over the grand turk 's head and then by a dexterous sleight pitch
-PRON- cap up into the mizentop for a shelf -PRON- go down rollick so
far at least as -PRON- remain visible from the deck reverse all other
procession by bring up the rear with music but ere step into
the cabin doorway below -PRON- pause ship a new face altogether and
then independent hilarious little flask enter king ahab 's presence
in the character of abjectus or the slave

-PRON- be not the least among the strange thing breed by the intense
artificialness of sea usage that while in the open air of the deck
some officer will upon provocation bear -PRON- boldly and
defyingly enough towards -PRON- commander yet ten to one let those
very officer the next moment go down to -PRON- customary dinner in that
same commander 's cabin and straightway -PRON- inoffensive not to say
deprecatory and humble air towards -PRON- as -PRON- sit at the head of
the table this be marvellous sometimes most comical wherefore this
difference a problem perhaps not to have be belshazzar king of
babylon and to have be belshazzar not haughtily but courteously
therein certainly must have be some touch of mundane grandeur but -PRON-
who in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit preside over -PRON- own
private dinner table of invite guest that man 's unchallenged power
and dominion of individual influence for the time that man 's royalty of
state transcend belshazzar 's for belshazzar be not the great who
have but once din -PRON- friend have taste what -PRON- be to be caesar -PRON-
be a witchery of social czarship which there be no withstanding now
if to this consideration -PRON- superadd the official supremacy of a
ship master then by inference -PRON- will derive the cause of that
peculiarity of sea life just mention

over -PRON- ivory inlay table ahab preside like a mute man
sea lion on the white coral beach surround by -PRON- warlike but still
deferential cub in -PRON- own proper turn each officer wait to be
serve -PRON- be as little child before ahab and yet in ahab
there seem not to lurk the small social arrogance with one mind
-PRON- intent eye all fasten upon the old man 's knife as -PRON- carve
the chief dish before -PRON- -PRON- do not suppose that for the world -PRON-
would have profane that moment with the slight observation even
upon so neutral a topic as the weather no and when reach out -PRON-
knife and fork between which the slice of beef be lock ahab thereby
motion starbuck 's plate towards -PRON- the mate receive -PRON- meat as
though receive alm and cut -PRON- tenderly and a little start
if perchance the knife graze against the plate and chew -PRON-
noiselessly and swallow -PRON- not without circumspection for like
the coronation banquet at frankfort where the german emperor profoundly
din with the seven imperial elector so these cabin meal be
somehow solemn meal eat in awful silence and yet at table old ahab
forbid not conversation only -PRON- -PRON- be dumb what a relief -PRON- be
to choke stubb when a rat make a sudden racket in the hold below and
poor little flask -PRON- be the young son and little boy of this weary
family party -PRON- be the shinbone of the saline beef -PRON- would have
be the drumstick for flask to have presume to help -PRON- this
must have seem to -PRON- tantamount to larceny in the first degree have
-PRON- help -PRON- at that table doubtless never more would -PRON- have
be able to hold -PRON- head up in this honest world nevertheless
strange to say ahab never forbid -PRON- and have flask help -PRON-
the chance be ahab have never so much as notice -PRON- least of all do
flask presume to help -PRON- to butter whether -PRON- think the owner
of the ship deny -PRON- to -PRON- on account of -PRON- clot -PRON- clear
sunny complexion or whether -PRON- deem that on so long a voyage in such
marketless water butter be at a premium and therefore be not for
-PRON- a subaltern however -PRON- be flask alas be a butterless man

another thing flask be the last person down at the dinner and flask
be the first man up consider for hereby flask 's dinner be badly
jam in point of time starbuck and stubb both have the start of -PRON-
and yet -PRON- also have the privilege of lounge in the rear if stubb
even who be but a peg high than flask happen to have but a small
appetite and soon show symptom of conclude -PRON- repast then flask
must bestir -PRON- -PRON- will not get more than three mouthful that day
for -PRON- be against holy usage for stubb to precede flask to the deck
therefore -PRON- be that flask once admit in private that ever since -PRON-
have arise to the dignity of an officer from that moment -PRON- have never
know what -PRON- be to be otherwise than hungry more or less for what
-PRON- eat do not so much relieve -PRON- hunger as keep -PRON- immortal in -PRON-
peace and satisfaction think flask have for ever depart from
-PRON- stomach -PRON- be an officer but how -PRON- wish -PRON- could fish a bit of
old fashioned beef in the forecastle as -PRON- use to when -PRON- be before the
mast there be the fruit of promotion now there be the vanity of glory
there be the insanity of life besides if -PRON- be so that any mere
sailor of the pequod have a grudge against flask in flask 's official
capacity all that sailor have to do in order to obtain ample vengeance
be to go aft at dinner time and get a peep at flask through the cabin
sky light sit silly and dumfoundered before awful ahab

now ahab and -PRON- three mate form what may be call the first table
in the pequod 's cabin after -PRON- departure take place in inverted
order to -PRON- arrival the canvas cloth be clear or rather be
restore to some hurried order by the pallid steward and then the three
harpooneer be bid to the feast -PRON- be -PRON- residuary legatee
-PRON- make a sort of temporary servant hall of the high and mighty
cabin

in strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless
invisible domineering of the captain 's table be the entire care free
license and ease the almost frantic democracy of those inferior fellow
the harpooneer while -PRON- master the mate seem afraid of the
sound of the hinge of -PRON- own jaw the harpooneer chew -PRON- food
with such a relish that there be a report to -PRON- -PRON- din like lord
-PRON- fill -PRON- belly like indian ship all day load with spice
such portentous appetite have queequeg and tashtego that to fill out
the vacancy make by the previous repast often the pale dough boy be
fain to bring on a great baron of salt junk seemingly quarried out of
the solid ox and if -PRON- be not lively about -PRON- if -PRON- do not go with
a nimble hop skip and jump then tashtego have an ungentlemanly way of
accelerate -PRON- by dart a fork at -PRON- back harpoon wise and once
daggoo seize with a sudden humor assist dough boy 's memory by
snatch -PRON- up bodily and thrust -PRON- head into a great empty
wooden trencher while tashtego knife in hand begin lay out the
circle preliminary to scalp -PRON- -PRON- be naturally a very nervous
shudder sort of little fellow this bread faced steward the progeny
of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse and what with the stand
spectacle of the black terrific ahab and the periodical tumultuous
visitation of these three savage dough boy 's whole life be one
continual lip quiver commonly after see the harpooneer furnish
with all thing -PRON- demand -PRON- would escape from -PRON- clutch into
-PRON- little pantry adjoining and fearfully peep out at -PRON- through the
blind of -PRON- door till all be over

-PRON- be a sight to see queequeg seat over against tashtego oppose
-PRON- file tooth to the indian 's crosswise to -PRON- daggoo seat on the
floor for a bench would have bring -PRON- hearse plumed head to the low
carline at every motion of -PRON- colossal limb make the low cabin
framework to shake as when an african elephant go passenger in a
ship but for all this the great negro be wonderfully abstemious
not to say dainty -PRON- seem hardly possible that by such comparatively
small mouthful -PRON- could keep up the vitality diffuse through so broad
baronial and superb a person but doubtless this noble savage fed
strong and drank deep of the abound element of air and through -PRON-
dilate nostril snuff in the sublime life of the world not by
beef or by bread be giant make or nourish but queequeg -PRON- have a
mortal barbaric smack of the lip in eat an ugly sound enough so
much so that the tremble dough boy almost look to see whether
any mark of tooth lurk in -PRON- own lean arm and when -PRON- would hear
tashtego sing out for -PRON- to produce -PRON- that -PRON- bone may be
pick the simple witted steward all but shatter the crockery hang
round -PRON- in the pantry by -PRON- sudden fit of the palsy nor do the
whetstone which the harpooneer carry in -PRON- pocket for -PRON-
lance and other weapon and with which whetstone at dinner -PRON-
would ostentatiously sharpen -PRON- knife that grating sound do not at
all tend to tranquillize poor dough boy how could -PRON- forget that in -PRON-
island day queequeg for one must certainly have be guilty of some
murderous convivial indiscretion alas dough boy hard fare the
white waiter who wait upon cannibal not a napkin should -PRON- carry on
-PRON- arm but a buckler in good time though to -PRON- great delight
the three salt sea warrior would rise and depart to -PRON- credulous
fable monger ear all -PRON- martial bone jingle in -PRON- at every
step like moorish scimetar in scabbard

but though these barbarian din in the cabin and nominally live
there still be anything but sedentary in -PRON- habit -PRON- be
scarcely ever in -PRON- except at mealtime and just before sleep time
when -PRON- pass through -PRON- to -PRON- own peculiar quarter

in this one matter ahab seem no exception to most american whale
captain who as a set rather incline to the opinion that by right
the ship 's cabin belong to -PRON- and that -PRON- be by courtesy alone that
anybody else be at any time permit there so that in real truth
the mate and harpooneer of the pequod may more properly be say to
have live out of the cabin than in -PRON- for when -PRON- do enter -PRON- -PRON-
be something as a street door enter a house turn inward for
a moment only to be turn out the next and as a permanent thing
reside in the open air nor do -PRON- lose much hereby in the cabin
be no companionship socially ahab be inaccessible though nominally
include in the census of christendom -PRON- be still an alien to -PRON- -PRON-
live in the world as the last of the grisly bears live in settle
missouri and as when spring and summer have depart that wild logan of
the wood bury -PRON- in the hollow of a tree live out the winter
there suck -PRON- own paw so in -PRON- inclement howl old age
ahab 's soul shut up in the cave trunk of -PRON- body there feed upon the
sullen paw of -PRON- gloom



chapter 35 the mast head


-PRON- be during the more pleasant weather that in due rotation with the
other seaman -PRON- first mast head come round

in most american whaleman the mast head be man almost
simultaneously with the vessel 's leave -PRON- port even though -PRON- may
have fifteen thousand mile and more to sail ere reach -PRON- proper
cruise ground and if after a three four or five year voyage
-PRON- be draw nigh home with anything empty in -PRON- say an empty vial
even then -PRON- mast head be keep manned to the last and not till -PRON-
skysail pole sail in among the spire of the port do -PRON- altogether
relinquish the hope of capture one whale more

now as the business of stand mast head ashore or afloat be a very
ancient and interesting one let -PRON- in some measure expatiate here
-PRON- take -PRON- that the early stander of mast head be the old
egyptians because in all -PRON- research -PRON- find none prior to -PRON-
for though -PRON- progenitor the builder of babel must doubtless by
-PRON- tower have intend to rear the lofty mast head in all asia
or africa either yet ere the final truck be put to -PRON- as that great
stone mast of -PRON- may be say to have go by the board in the dread
gale of god 's wrath therefore -PRON- can not give these babel builder
priority over the egyptians and that the egyptians be a nation of
mast head stander be an assertion base upon the general belief among
archaeologist that the first pyramid be found for astronomical
purpose a theory singularly support by the peculiar stair like
formation of all four side of those edifice whereby with prodigious
long uplifting of -PRON- leg those old astronomer be will not to mount
to the apex and sing out for new star even as the look out of a
modern ship sing out for a sail or a whale just bear in sight in
saint stylites the famous christian hermit of old time who build -PRON-
a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spend the whole latter portion of
-PRON- life on -PRON- summit hoist -PRON- food from the ground with a
tackle in -PRON- -PRON- have a remarkable instance of a dauntless
stander of mast head who be not to be drive from -PRON- place by fog
or frost rain hail or sleet but valiantly face everything out to
the last literally die at -PRON- post of modern stander of mast head
-PRON- have but a lifeless set mere stone iron and bronze man who
though well capable of face out a stiff gale be still entirely
incompetent to the business of sing out upon discover any strange
sight there be napoleon who upon the top of the column of vendome
stand with arm fold some one hundred and fifty foot in the air
careless now who rule the deck below whether louis philippe louis
blanc or louis the devil great washington too stand high aloft on
-PRON- tower main mast in baltimore and like one of hercules pillar
-PRON- column mark that point of human grandeur beyond which few mortal
will go admiral nelson also on a capstan of gun metal stand -PRON-
mast head in trafalgar square and ever when most obscure by that
london smoke token be yet give that a hidden hero be there for
where there be smoke must be fire but neither great washington nor
napoleon nor nelson will answer a single hail from below however
madly invoke to befriend by -PRON- counsel the distracted deck
upon which -PRON- gaze however -PRON- may be surmise that -PRON- spirit
penetrate through the thick haze of the future and descry what shoal
and what rock must be shun

-PRON- may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast head
stander of the land with those of the sea but that in truth -PRON- be
not so be plainly evince by an item for which obed macy the sole
historian of nantucket stand accountable the worthy obed tell -PRON-
that in the early time of the whale fishery ere ship be regularly
launch in pursuit of the game the people of that island erect lofty
spar along the sea coast to which the look out ascend by mean
of nail cleat something as fowl go upstairs in a hen house a few
year ago this same plan be adopt by the bay whaleman of new zealand
who upon descry the game give notice to the ready man boat nigh
the beach but this custom have now become obsolete turn -PRON- then to the
one proper mast head that of a whale ship at sea the three mast head
be keep man from sun rise to sun set the seaman take -PRON-
regular turn as at the helm and relieve each other every two
hour in the serene weather of the tropic -PRON- be exceedingly pleasant
the mast head nay to a dreamy meditative man -PRON- be delightful there
-PRON- stand a hundred foot above the silent deck stride along the
deep as if the mast be gigantic stilt while beneath -PRON- and
between -PRON- leg as -PRON- be swim the huge monster of the sea even
as ship once sail between the boot of the famous colossus at old
rhodes there -PRON- stand lose in the infinite series of the sea with
nothing ruffle but the wave the tranced ship indolently roll the
drowsy trade wind blow everything resolve -PRON- into languor for the
most part in this tropic whale life a sublime uneventfulness invest
-PRON- -PRON- hear no news read no gazette extra with startle account
of commonplace never delude -PRON- into unnecessary excitement -PRON- hear
of no domestic affliction bankrupt security fall of stock be
never trouble with the thought of what -PRON- shall have for dinner for
all -PRON- meal for three year and more be snugly stow in cask and
-PRON- bill of fare be immutable

in one of those southern whalesman on a long three or four year
voyage as often happen the sum of the various hour -PRON- spend at the
mast head would amount to several entire month and -PRON- be much to be
deplore that the place to which -PRON- devote so considerable a portion
of the whole term of -PRON- natural life should be so sadly destitute
of anything approach to a cosy inhabitiveness or adapt to breed a
comfortable localness of feeling such as pertain to a bed a hammock
a hearse a sentry box a pulpit a coach or any other of those small
and snug contrivance in which man temporarily isolate -PRON- -PRON-
most usual point of perch be the head of the t gallant mast where -PRON-
stand upon two thin parallel stick almost peculiar to whaleman call
the t gallant cross tree here toss about by the sea the beginner
feel about as cosy as -PRON- would stand on a bull 's horn to be sure
in cold weather -PRON- may carry -PRON- house aloft with -PRON- in the shape of
a watch coat but properly speak the thick watch coat be no more
of a house than the unclad body for as the soul be glue inside of -PRON-
fleshy tabernacle and can not freely move about in -PRON- nor even move out
of -PRON- without run great risk of perish like an ignorant pilgrim
cross the snowy alps in winter so a watch coat be not so much of
a house as -PRON- be a mere envelope or additional skin encase -PRON- -PRON-
can not put a shelf or chest of drawer in -PRON- body and no more can -PRON-
make a convenient closet of -PRON- watch coat

concern all this -PRON- be much to be deplore that the mast head of a
southern whale ship be unprovided with those enviable little tent
or pulpit call crow's nests in which the look out of a greenland
whaler be protect from the inclement weather of the frozen sea in
the fireside narrative of captain sleet entitled a voyage among the
icebergs in quest of the greenland whale and incidentally for the
re discovery of the lost icelandic colonies of old greenland in
this admirable volume all stander of mast head be furnish with
a charmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invent
crow's nest of the glacier which be the name of captain sleet 's good
craft -PRON- call -PRON- the sleet 's crow's nest in honour of -PRON- -PRON-
be the original inventor and patentee and free from all ridiculous
false delicacy and hold that if -PRON- call -PRON- own child after -PRON-
own name -PRON- father be the original inventor and patentee so
likewise should -PRON- denominate after -PRON- any other apparatus -PRON-
may beget in shape the sleet 's crow's nest be something like a large
tierce or pipe -PRON- be open above however where -PRON- be furnish with
a movable side screen to keep to windward of -PRON- head in a hard gale
be fix on the summit of the mast -PRON- ascend into -PRON- through a
little trap hatch in the bottom on the after side or side next the
stern of the ship be a comfortable seat with a locker underneath for
umbrella comforter and coat in front be a leather rack in which
to keep -PRON- speak trumpet pipe telescope and other nautical
convenience when captain sleet in person stand -PRON- mast head in this
crow's nest of -PRON- -PRON- tell -PRON- that -PRON- always have a rifle with -PRON-
also fix in the rack together with a powder flask and shot for
the purpose of pop off the stray narwhale or vagrant sea unicorn
infest those water for -PRON- can not successfully shoot at -PRON- from
the deck owe to the resistance of the water but to shoot down upon
-PRON- be a very different thing now -PRON- be plainly a labor of love
for captain sleet to describe as -PRON- do all the little detailed
convenience of -PRON- crow's nest but though -PRON- so enlarge upon many
of these and though -PRON- treat -PRON- to a very scientific account of -PRON-
experiment in this crow's nest with a small compass -PRON- keep there for
the purpose of counteract the error result from what be call
the local attraction of all binnacle magnet an error ascribable to
the horizontal vicinity of the iron in the ship 's plank and in the
glacier 's case perhaps to there have be so many break down
blacksmith among -PRON- crew -PRON- say that though the captain be very
discreet and scientific here yet for all -PRON- learn binnacle
deviation azimuth compass observation and approximate error
-PRON- know very well captain sleet that -PRON- be not so much immerse
in those profound magnetic meditation as to fail be attract
occasionally towards that well replenished little case bottle so nicely
tuck in on one side of -PRON- crow 's nest within easy reach of -PRON- hand
though upon the whole -PRON- greatly admire and even love the brave the
honest and learn captain yet -PRON- take -PRON- very ill of -PRON- that -PRON-
should so utterly ignore that case bottle see what a faithful friend
and comforter -PRON- must have be while with mittened finger and hooded
head -PRON- be study the mathematic aloft there in that bird 's nest
within three or four perch of the pole

but if -PRON- southern whale fisher be not so snugly house aloft as
captain sleet and -PRON- greenlandmen be yet that disadvantage be
greatly counter balance by the widely contrast serenity of those
seductive sea in which -PRON- south fisher mostly float for one -PRON- use
to lounge up the rig very leisurely rest in the top to have a
chat with queequeg or any one else off duty whom -PRON- may find there
then ascend a little way further and throw a lazy leg over the
top sail yard take a preliminary view of the watery pasture and so at
last mount to -PRON- ultimate destination

let -PRON- make a clean breast of -PRON- here and frankly admit that -PRON- keep but
sorry guard with the problem of the universe revolve in -PRON- how
could -PRON- be leave completely to -PRON- at such a thought engender
altitude how could -PRON- but lightly hold -PRON- obligation to observe all
whale ship standing order keep -PRON- weather eye open and sing out
every time

and let -PRON- in this place movingly admonish -PRON- ye ship owner of
nantucket beware of enlist in -PRON- vigilant fishery any lad with
lean brow and hollow eye give to unseasonable meditativeness and who
offer to ship with the phaedon instead of bowditch in -PRON- head beware
of such an one -PRON- say -PRON- whale must be see before -PRON- can be
kill and this sink eye young platonist will tow -PRON- ten wake
round the world and never make -PRON- one pint of sperm the rich nor
be these monition at all unneeded for nowadays the whale fishery
furnish an asylum for many romantic melancholy and absent minded
young man disgust with the carking care of earth and seek
sentiment in tar and blubber childe harold not unfrequently perch
-PRON- upon the mast head of some luckless disappointed whale ship and
in moody phrase ejaculates:--

roll on thou deep and dark blue ocean roll ten thousand
blubber hunter sweep over thee in vain

very often do the captain of such ship take those absent minded
young philosopher to task upbraid -PRON- with not feel sufficient
interest in the voyage half hint that -PRON- be so hopelessly lose
to all honourable ambition as that in -PRON- secret soul -PRON- would
rather not see whale than otherwise but all in vain those young
platonist have a notion that -PRON- vision be imperfect -PRON- be
short sighted what use then to strain the visual nerve -PRON- have
leave -PRON- opera glass at home

why thou monkey say a harpooneer to one of these lad -PRON- 've be
cruise now hard upon three year and thou hast not raise a whale
yet whale be scarce as hen 's tooth whenever thou art up here
perhaps -PRON- be or perhaps there may have be shoal of -PRON- in
the far horizon but lull into such an opium like listlessness of
vacant unconscious reverie be this absent minded youth by the blending
cadence of wave with thought that at last -PRON- lose -PRON- identity
take the mystic ocean at -PRON- foot for the visible image of that deep
blue bottomless soul pervade mankind and nature and every
strange half see glide beautiful thing that elude -PRON- every
dimly discover uprising fin of some undiscernible form seem to -PRON-
the embodiment of those elusive thought that only people the soul by
continually flit through -PRON- in this enchanted mood thy spirit ebb
away to whence -PRON- come become diffuse through time and space like
crammer's(thomas cranmer sprinkle pantheistic ash form at last a part of every
shore the round globe over

there be no life in thee now except that rock life impart by a
gently roll ship by -PRON- borrow from the sea by the sea from
the inscrutable tide of god but while this sleep this dream be on ye
move -PRON- foot or hand an inch slip -PRON- hold at all and -PRON- identity
come back in horror over descartian vortex -PRON- hover and perhaps
at mid day in the fair weather with one half throttle shriek -PRON-
drop through that transparent air into the summer sea no more to rise
for ever heed -PRON- well ye pantheists



chapter 36 the quarter deck


enter ahab then all


-PRON- be not a great while after the affair of the pipe that one
morning shortly after breakfast ahab as be -PRON- wo nt ascend the
cabin gangway to the deck there most sea captain usually walk at that
hour as country gentleman after the same meal take a few turn in the
garden

soon -PRON- steady ivory stride be hear as to and fro -PRON- pace -PRON- old
round upon plank so familiar to -PRON- tread that -PRON- be all over
dent like geological stone with the peculiar mark of -PRON- walk do
-PRON- fixedly gaze too upon that ribbed and dent brow there also
-PRON- would see still strange foot print the foot print of -PRON- one
unsleeping ever pace thought

but on the occasion in question those dent look deeper even as
-PRON- nervous step that morning leave a deep mark and so full of -PRON-
thought be ahab that at every uniform turn that -PRON- make now at the
main mast and now at the binnacle -PRON- could almost see that thought
turn in -PRON- as -PRON- turn and pace in -PRON- as -PRON- pace so completely
possess -PRON- indeed that -PRON- all but seem the inward mould of every
outer movement

d'ye mark -PRON- flask whisper stubb the chick that be in -PRON- peck
the shell twill soon be out

the hour wear on ahab now shut up within -PRON- cabin anon pace the
deck with the same intense bigotry of purpose in -PRON- aspect

-PRON- draw near the close of day suddenly -PRON- come to a halt by the
bulwark and insert -PRON- bone leg into the auger hole there and with
one hand grasp a shroud -PRON- order starbuck to send everybody aft

sir say the mate astonish at an order seldom or never give on
ship board except in some extraordinary case

send everybody aft repeat ahab mast head there come down

when the entire ship 's company be assemble and with curious and not
wholly unapprehensive face be eye -PRON- for -PRON- look not unlike
the weather horizon when a storm be come up ahab after rapidly
glance over the bulwark and then dart -PRON- eye among the crew
start from -PRON- standpoint and as though not a soul be nigh -PRON-
resume -PRON- heavy turn upon the deck with bent head and half slouch
hat -PRON- continue to pace unmindful of the wondering whispering among
the man till stubb cautiously whisper to flask that ahab must have
summon -PRON- there for the purpose of witness a pedestrian feat but
this do not last long vehemently pause -PRON- cried:--

what do ye do when ye see a whale man

sing out for -PRON- be the impulsive rejoinder from a score of club
voice

good cry ahab with a wild approval in -PRON- tone observe the
hearty animation into which -PRON- unexpected question have so magnetically
throw -PRON-

and what do ye next man

lower away and after -PRON-

and what tune be -PRON- ye pull to man

a dead whale or a stove boat

more and more strangely and fiercely glad and approve grow the
countenance of the old man at every shout while the mariner begin
to gaze curiously at each other as if marvel how -PRON- be that -PRON-
-PRON- become so excited at such seemingly purposeless question

but -PRON- be all eagerness again as ahab now half revolve in -PRON-
pivot hole with one hand reach high up a shroud and tightly almost
convulsively grasp -PRON- address -PRON- thus:--

all ye mast header have before now hear -PRON- give order about a white
whale look ye d'ye see this spanish ounce of gold hold up a
broad bright coin to the sun--"it be a sixteen dollar piece man d'ye
see -PRON- mr. starbuck hand -PRON- yon top maul

while the mate be get the hammer ahab without speak be
slowly rub the gold piece against the skirt of -PRON- jacket as if
to heighten -PRON- lustre and without use any word be meanwhile
lowly hum to -PRON- produce a sound so strangely muffled and
inarticulate that -PRON- seem the mechanical humming of the wheel of -PRON-
vitality in -PRON-

receive the top maul from starbuck -PRON- advance towards the main mast
with the hammer uplift in one hand exhibit the gold with the
other and with a high raise voice exclaim whosoever of ye
raise -PRON- a white headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw
whosoever of ye raise -PRON- that white headed whale with three hole
puncture in -PRON- starboard fluke look ye whosoever of ye raise -PRON-
that same white whale -PRON- shall have this gold ounce -PRON- boy

huzza huzza cry the seaman as with swing tarpaulin -PRON-
hail the act of nail the gold to the mast

-PRON- be a white whale -PRON- say resume ahab as -PRON- throw down the topmaul
a white whale skin -PRON- eye for -PRON- man look sharp for white water
if ye see but a bubble sing out

all this while tashtego daggoo and queequeg have look on with even
more intense interest and surprise than the rest and at the mention
of the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw -PRON- have start as if each be
separately touch by some specific recollection

captain ahab say tashtego that white whale must be the same that
some call moby dick

moby dick shout ahab do ye know the white whale then tash

do -PRON- fan tail a little curious sir before -PRON- go down say the
gay header deliberately

and have -PRON- a curious spout too say daggoo very bushy even for a
parmacetty and mighty quick captain ahab

and -PRON- have one two three oh good many iron in -PRON- hide too
captain cry queequeg disjointedly all twiske tee be twisk like
-PRON- him-- falter hard for a word and screw -PRON- hand round and

chapter 41 moby dick


-PRON- ishmael be one of that crew -PRON- shout have go up with the rest
-PRON- oath have be weld with -PRON- and strong -PRON- shout and more
do -PRON- hammer and clinch -PRON- oath because of the dread in -PRON- soul a
wild mystical sympathetical feeling be in -PRON- ahab 's quenchless feud
seem -PRON- with greedy ear -PRON- learn the history of that murderous
monster against whom -PRON- and all the other have take -PRON- oath of
violence and revenge

for some time past though at interval only the unaccompanied
secluded white whale have haunt those uncivilized sea mostly
frequent by the sperm whale fisherman but not all of -PRON- know of -PRON-
existence only a few of -PRON- comparatively have knowingly see -PRON-
while the number who as yet have actually and knowingly give battle to
-PRON- be small indeed for owe to the large number of whale cruiser
the disorderly way -PRON- be sprinkle over the entire watery
circumference many of -PRON- adventurously push -PRON- quest along
solitary latitude so as seldom or never for a whole twelvemonth or
more on a stretch to encounter a single news tell sail of any sort
the inordinate length of each separate voyage the irregularity of the
time of sail from home all these with other circumstance direct
and indirect long obstruct the spread through the whole world wide
whaling fleet of the special individualizing tiding concern moby
dick -PRON- be hardly to be doubt that several vessel report to have
encounter at such or such a time or on such or such a meridian
a sperm whale of uncommon magnitude and malignity which whale after
do great mischief to -PRON- assailant have completely escape -PRON- to
some mind -PRON- be not an unfair presumption -PRON- say that the whale in
question must have be no other than moby dick yet as of late the
sperm whale fishery have be mark by various and not unfrequent
instance of great ferocity cunning and malice in the monster
attack therefore -PRON- be that those who by accident ignorantly give
battle to moby dick such hunter perhaps for the most part be
content to ascribe the peculiar terror -PRON- breed more as -PRON- be to
the peril of the sperm whale fishery at large than to the individual
cause in that way mostly the disastrous encounter between ahab and
the whale have hitherto be popularly regard

and as for those who previously hearing of the white whale by chance
catch sight of -PRON- in the beginning of the thing -PRON- have every one of
-PRON- almost as boldly and fearlessly lower for -PRON- as for any other
whale of that species but at length such calamity do ensue in these
assault not restrict to sprained wrist and ankle break limb or
devour amputation but fatal to the last degree of fatality those
repeat disastrous repulse all accumulate and pile -PRON- terror
upon moby dick those thing have go far to shake the fortitude of many
brave hunter to whom the story of the white whale have eventually come

nor do wild rumor of all sort fail to exaggerate and still the more
horrify the true history of these deadly encounter for not only do
fabulous rumor naturally grow out of the very body of all surprising
terrible event as the smitten tree give birth to -PRON- fungi but in
maritime life far more than in that of terra firma wild rumor abound
wherever there be any adequate reality for -PRON- to cling to and as the
sea surpass the land in this matter so the whale fishery surpasses
every other sort of maritime life in the wonderfulness and fearfulness
of the rumor which sometimes circulate there for not only be whaleman
as a body unexempt from that ignorance and superstitiousness hereditary
to all sailor but of all sailor -PRON- be by all odd the most
directly bring into contact with whatever be appallingly astonishing
in the sea face to face -PRON- not only eye -PRON- great marvel but
hand to jaw give battle to -PRON- alone in such remotest water that
though -PRON- sail a thousand mile and pass a thousand shore -PRON-
would not come to any chisel hearth stone or aught hospitable beneath
that part of the sun in such latitude and longitude pursue too
such a calling as -PRON- do the whaleman be wrap by influence all
tend to make -PRON- fancy pregnant with many a mighty birth

no wonder then that ever gather volume from the mere transit over
the wide watery space the outblown rumor of the white whale do
in the end incorporate with -PRON- all manner of morbid hint
and half form foetal suggestion of supernatural agency which
eventually invest moby dick with new terror unborrow from anything
that visibly appear so that in many case such a panic do -PRON- finally
strike that few who by those rumor at least have hear of the white
whale few of those hunter be willing to encounter the peril of -PRON-
jaw

but there be still other and more vital practical influence at work
not even at the present day have the original prestige of the sperm
whale as fearfully distinguish from all other specie of the
leviathan die out of the mind of the whaleman as a body there be
those this day among -PRON- who though intelligent and courageous
enough in offer battle to the greenland or right whale would
perhaps either from professional inexperience or incompetency or
timidity decline a contest with the sperm whale at any rate there be
plenty of whaleman especially among those whale nation not sail
under the american flag who have never hostilely encounter the sperm
whale but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan be restrict to
the ignoble monster primitively pursue in the north seat on -PRON-
hatch these man will hearken with a childish fireside interest
and awe to the wild strange tale of southern whaling nor be the
pre eminent tremendousness of the great sperm whale anywhere more
feelingly comprehend than on board of those prow which stem -PRON-

and as if the now test reality of -PRON- might have in former
legendary time throw -PRON- shadow before -PRON- -PRON- find some book
naturalist olassen and povelson declare the sperm whale not only to
be a consternation to every other creature in the sea but also to be so
incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human blood nor
even down to so late a time as cuvier 's be these or almost similar
impression efface for in -PRON- natural history the baron -PRON-
affirm that at sight of the sperm whale all fish shark include be
strike with the most lively terror and often in the precipitancy of
-PRON- flight dash -PRON- against the rock with such violence as to
cause instantaneous death and however the general experience in the
fishery may amend such report as these yet in -PRON- full terribleness
even to the bloodthirsty item of povelson the superstitious belief in
-PRON- be in some vicissitude of -PRON- vocation revive in the mind of
the hunter

so that overawe by the rumor and portent concern -PRON- not a few of
the fisherman recall in reference to moby dick the early day
of the sperm whale fishery when -PRON- be oftentimes hard to induce long
practise right whaleman to embark in the peril of this new and daring
warfare such man protest that although other leviathan may be
hopefully pursue yet to chase and point lance at such an apparition
as the sperm whale be not for mortal man that to attempt -PRON- would
be inevitably to be tear into a quick eternity on this head there be
some remarkable document that may be consult

nevertheless some there be who even in the face of these thing
be ready to give chase to moby dick and a still great number who
chance only to hear of -PRON- distantly and vaguely without the
specific detail of any certain calamity and without superstitious
accompaniment be sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if
offer

one of the wild suggestion refer to as at last come to be link
with the white whale in the mind of the superstitiously incline
be the unearthly conceit that moby dick be ubiquitous that -PRON- have
actually be encounter in opposite latitude at one and the same
instant of time

nor credulous as such mind must have be be this conceit altogether
without some faint show of superstitious probability for as the secret
of the current in the sea have never yet be divulge even to
the most erudite research so the hidden way of the sperm whale
when beneath the surface remain in great part unaccountable to -PRON-
pursuer and from time to time have originate the most curious and
contradictory speculation regard -PRON- especially concern the
mystic mode whereby after sound to a great depth -PRON- transport
-PRON- with such vast swiftness to the most widely distant point

-PRON- be a thing well known to both american and english whale ship and
as well a thing place upon authoritative record year ago by scoresby
that some whale have be capture far north in the pacific in whose
body have be find the barb of harpoon dart in the greenland
sea nor be -PRON- to be gainsay that in some of these instance -PRON- have
be declare that the interval of time between the two assault could
not have exceed very many day hence by inference -PRON- have be
believe by some whaleman that the nor west passage so long a problem
to man be never a problem to the whale so that here in the real
live experience of live man the prodigy relate in old time of
the inland strello mountain in portugal near whose top there be say
to be a lake in which the wreck of ship float up to the surface
and that still more wonderful story of the arethusa fountain near
syracuse whose water be believe to have come from the holy land
by an underground passage these fabulous narration be almost fully
equal by the reality of the whaleman

force into familiarity then with such prodigy as these and know
that after repeat intrepid assault the white whale have escape
alive -PRON- can not be much matter of surprise that some whaleman should
go still further in -PRON- superstition declare moby dick not only
ubiquitous but immortal for immortality be but ubiquity in time that
though grove of spear should be plant in -PRON- flank -PRON- would still
swim away unharmed or if indeed -PRON- should ever be make to spout thick
blood such a sight would be but a ghastly deception for again in
unensanguined billow hundred of league away -PRON- unsullied jet would
once more be see

but even strip of these supernatural surmising there be enough in
the earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strike
the imagination with unwonted power for -PRON- be not so much -PRON-
uncommon bulk that so much distinguish -PRON- from other sperm whale
but as be elsewhere throw out a peculiar snow white wrinkled
forehead and a high pyramidical white hump these be -PRON- prominent
feature the token whereby even in the limitless uncharted sea -PRON-
reveal -PRON- identity at a long distance to those who know -PRON-

the rest of -PRON- body be so streaked and spot and marble with
the same shroud hue that in the end -PRON- have gain -PRON- distinctive
appellation of the white whale a name indeed literally justify by
-PRON- vivid aspect when see glide at high noon through a dark blue
sea leave a milky way wake of creamy foam all spangle with golden
gleaming

nor be -PRON- -PRON- unwonted magnitude nor -PRON- remarkable hue nor yet -PRON-
deformed low jaw that so much invest the whale with natural terror
as that unexampled intelligent malignity which accord to specific
account -PRON- have over and over again evince in -PRON- assault more than
all -PRON- treacherous retreat strike more of dismay than perhaps aught
else for when swim before -PRON- exult pursuer with every
apparent symptom of alarm -PRON- have several time be know to turn
round suddenly and bear down upon -PRON- either stave -PRON- boat to
splinter or drive -PRON- back in consternation to -PRON- ship

already several fatality have attend -PRON- chase but though similar
disaster however little bruited ashore be by no mean unusual
in the fishery yet in most instance such seem the white whale 's
infernal aforethought of ferocity that every dismembering or death
that -PRON- cause be not wholly regard as have be inflict by an
unintelligent agent

judge then to what pitch of inflame distract fury the mind of
-PRON- more desperate hunter be impel when amid the chip of chew
boat and the sink limb of tear comrade -PRON- swim out of the
white curd of the whale 's direful wrath into the serene exasperate
sunlight that smile on as if at a birth or a bridal

-PRON- three boat stave around -PRON- and oar and man both whirl in the
eddy one captain seize the line knife from -PRON- break prow have
dash at the whale as an arkansas duellist at -PRON- foe blindly seek
with a six inch blade to reach the fathom deep life of the whale
that captain be ahab and then -PRON- be that suddenly sweep -PRON-
sickle shape low jaw beneath -PRON- moby dick have reap away ahab 's
leg as a mower a blade of grass in the field no turbaned turk no
hire venetian or malay could have smite -PRON- with more seeming malice
small reason be there to doubt then that ever since that almost fatal
encounter ahab have cherish a wild vindictiveness against the whale
all the more fell for that in -PRON- frantic morbidness -PRON- at last come
to identify with -PRON- not only all -PRON- bodily woe but all -PRON-
intellectual and spiritual exasperation the white whale swim before
-PRON- as the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agency which
some deep man feel eat in -PRON- till -PRON- be leave live on with
half a heart and half a lung that intangible malignity which have be
from the beginning to whose dominion even the modern christians ascribe
one half of the world which the ancient ophites of the east reverence
in -PRON- statue devil ahab do not fall down and worship -PRON- like -PRON-
but deliriously transfer -PRON- idea to the abhorred white whale -PRON-
pit -PRON- all mutilate against -PRON- all that most madden and
torment all that stir up the lee of thing all truth with malice
in -PRON- all that crack the sinew and cake the brain all the subtle
demonism of life and think all evil to crazy ahab be visibly
personify and make practically assailable in moby dick -PRON- pile upon
the whale 's white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate feel
by -PRON- whole race from adam down and then as if -PRON- chest have be a
mortar -PRON- burst -PRON- hot heart 's shell upon -PRON-

-PRON- be not probable that this monomania in -PRON- take -PRON- instant rise at
the precise time of -PRON- bodily dismemberment then in dart at the
monster knife in hand -PRON- have but give loose to a sudden passionate
corporal animosity and when -PRON- receive the stroke that tear -PRON- -PRON-
probably but feel the agonizing bodily laceration but nothing more
yet when by this collision force to turn towards home and for long
month of day and week ahab and anguish lie stretch together in one
hammock round in mid winter that dreary howl patagonian cape
then -PRON- be that -PRON- torn body and gashed soul bleed into one another
and so interfus make -PRON- mad that -PRON- be only then on the homeward
voyage after the encounter that the final monomania seize -PRON- seem
all but certain from the fact that at interval during the passage
-PRON- be a rave lunatic and though unlimbed of a leg yet such vital
strength yet lurk in -PRON- egyptian chest and be moreover intensify
by -PRON- delirium that -PRON- mate be force to lace -PRON- fast even
there as -PRON- sail rave in -PRON- hammock in a strait jacket -PRON- swing
to the mad rocking of the gale and when run into more sufferable
latitude the ship with mild stun'sail spread float across the
tranquil tropic and to all appearance the old man 's delirium seem
leave behind -PRON- with the cape horn swell and -PRON- come forth from -PRON-
dark den into the blessed light and air even then when -PRON- bear that
firm collect front however pale and issue -PRON- calm order once
again and -PRON- mate thank god the direful madness be now go even
then ahab in -PRON- hide self rave on human madness be oftentimes a
cunning and most feline thing when -PRON- think -PRON- flee -PRON- may have but
become transfigure into some still subtle form ahab 's full lunacy
subside not but deepeningly contract like the unabated hudson
when that noble northman flow narrowly but unfathomably through the
highland gorge but as in -PRON- narrow flow monomania not one jot of
ahab 's broad madness have be leave behind so in that broad madness not
one jot of -PRON- great natural intellect have perish that before live
agent now become the live instrument if such a furious trope may
stand -PRON- special lunacy storm -PRON- general sanity and carry -PRON-
and turn all -PRON- concentre cannon upon -PRON- own mad mark so that far
from have lose -PRON- strength ahab to that one end do now possess a
thousand fold more potency than ever -PRON- have sanely bring to bear upon
any one reasonable object

this be much yet ahab 's large dark deep part remain unhinted
but vain to popularize profundity and all truth be profound wind
far down from within the very heart of this spike hotel de cluny where
-PRON- here stand however grand and wonderful now quit -PRON- and take -PRON-
way ye noble sad soul to those vast roman hall of therme
where far beneath the fantastic tower of man 's upper earth -PRON- root
of grandeur -PRON- whole awful essence sit in bearded state an antique
bury beneath antiquity and throne on torsoe so with a broken
throne the great god mock that captive king so like a caryatid -PRON-
patient sit uphold on -PRON- frozen brow the pile entablature of
age wind ye down there ye proud sad soul question that proud
sad king a family likeness aye -PRON- do beget ye ye young exiled
royalty and from -PRON- grim sire only will the old state secret come

now in -PRON- heart ahab have some glimpse of this namely all -PRON- mean
be sane -PRON- motive and -PRON- object mad yet without power to kill or
change or shun the fact -PRON- likewise know that to mankind -PRON- do long
dissemble in some sort do still but that thing of -PRON- dissembling
be only subject to -PRON- perceptibility not to -PRON- will determinate
nevertheless so well do -PRON- succeed in that dissembling that when
with ivory leg -PRON- step ashore at last no nantucketer think -PRON-
otherwise than but naturally grieve and that to the quick with the
terrible casualty which have overtake -PRON-

the report of -PRON- undeniable delirium at sea be likewise popularly
ascribe to a kindred cause and so too all the add moodiness which
always afterwards to the very day of sailing in the pequod on the
present voyage sit brood on -PRON- brow nor be -PRON- so very unlikely
that far from distrust -PRON- fitness for another whaling voyage on
account of such dark symptom the calculate people of that prudent
isle be incline to harbor the conceit that for those very reason -PRON-
be all the better qualified and set on edge for a pursuit so full
of rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whale gnaw within and
scorch without with the infixed unrelenting fang of some incurable
idea such an one could -PRON- be find would seem the very man to dart
-PRON- iron and lift -PRON- lance against the most appalling of all brute
or if for any reason think to be corporeally incapacitate for that
yet such an one would seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl on
-PRON- underling to the attack but be all this as -PRON- may certain -PRON- be
that with the mad secret of -PRON- unabated rage bolt up and key in
-PRON- ahab have purposely sail upon the present voyage with the one only
and all engrossing object of hunt the white whale have any one of -PRON-
old acquaintance on shore but half dream of what be lurk in -PRON-
then how soon would -PRON- aghast and righteous soul have wrench the
ship from such a fiendish man -PRON- be bent on profitable cruise the
profit to be count down in dollar from the mint -PRON- be intent on an
audacious immitigable and supernatural revenge

here then be this grey head ungodly old man chase with curse a
job 's whale round the world at the head of a crew too chiefly make
up of mongrel renegade and castaway and cannibal morally enfeebled
also by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or right mindedness in
starbuck the invulnerable jollity of indifference and recklessness in
stubb and the pervade mediocrity in flask such a crew so officered
seem specially pick and pack by some infernal fatality to help -PRON-
to -PRON- monomaniac revenge how -PRON- be that -PRON- so aboundingly respond
to the old man 's ire by what evil magic -PRON- soul be possess
that at time -PRON- hate seem almost their the white whale as much
-PRON- insufferable foe as -PRON- how all this come to be what the white
whale be to -PRON- or how to -PRON- unconscious understanding also in
some dim unsuspected way -PRON- may have seem the glide great demon
of the sea of life all this to explain would be to dive deep than
ishmael can go the subterranean miner that work in -PRON- all how can one
tell whither lead -PRON- shaft by the ever shift muffled sound of -PRON-
pick who do not feel the irresistible arm drag what skiff in tow
of a seventy four can stand still for one -PRON- give -PRON- up to the
abandonment of the time and the place but while yet all a rush to
encounter the whale could see naught in that brute but the deadly
ill



chapter 42 the whiteness of the whale


what the white whale be to ahab have be hint what at time -PRON-
be to -PRON- as yet remain unsaid

aside from those more obvious consideration touch moby dick which
could not but occasionally awaken in any man 's soul some alarm there
be another thought or rather vague nameless horror concern -PRON-
which at time by -PRON- intensity completely overpower all the rest and
yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable be -PRON- that -PRON- almost despair of
put -PRON- in a comprehensible form -PRON- be the whiteness of the whale
that above all thing appal -PRON- but how can -PRON- hope to explain -PRON-
here and yet in some dim random way explain -PRON- -PRON- must else all
these chapter may be naught

though in many natural object whiteness refiningly enhance beauty as
if impart some special virtue of -PRON- own as in marble japonicas
and pearl and though various nation have in some way recognise a
certain royal preeminence in this hue even the barbaric grand old
king of pegu place the title lord of the white elephants above all
-PRON- other magniloquent ascription of dominion and the modern king
of siam unfurl the same snow white quadruped in the royal standard
and the hanoverian flag bear the one figure of a snow white charger
and the great austrian empire caesarian heir to overlord rome
have for the imperial colour the same imperial hue and though this
pre eminence in -PRON- apply to the human race -PRON- give the white
man ideal mastership over every dusky tribe and though besides all
this whiteness have be even make significant of gladness for among
the romans a white stone mark a joyful day and though in other mortal
sympathy and symbolizing this same hue be make the emblem of many
touch noble thing the innocence of bride the benignity of age
though among the red men of america the giving of the white belt
of wampum be the deep pledge of honour though in many clime
whiteness typify the majesty of justice in the ermine of the judge
and contribute to the daily state of king and queen draw by
milk white steed though even in the high mystery of the most
august religion -PRON- have be make the symbol of the divine spotlessness
and power by the persian fire worshipper the white forked flame be
hold the holy on the altar and in the greek mythology great jove
-PRON- be make incarnate in a snow white bull and though to the
noble iroquois the midwinter sacrifice of the sacred white dog be
by far the holy festival of -PRON- theology that spotless faithful
creature be hold the pure envoy -PRON- could send to the great spirit
with the annual tiding of -PRON- own fidelity and though directly from
the latin word for white all christian priest derive the name of
one part of -PRON- sacred vesture the alb or tunic wear beneath the
cassock and though among the holy pomp of the romish faith white be
specially employ in the celebration of the passion of -PRON- lord though
in the vision of st. john white robe be give to the redeem and
the four and twenty elder stand clothed in white before the great white
throne and the holy one that sitteth there white like wool yet for all
these accumulate association with whatever be sweet and honourable
and sublime there yet lurk an elusive something in the innermost idea
of this hue which strike more of panic to the soul than that redness
which affright in blood

this elusive quality -PRON- be which cause the thought of whiteness when
divorce from more kindly association and couple with any object
terrible in -PRON- to heighten that terror to the furth bound
witness the white bear of the pole and the white shark of the tropic
what but -PRON- smooth flaky whiteness make -PRON- the transcendent
horror -PRON- be that ghastly whiteness -PRON- be which impart such an
abhorrent mildness even more loathsome than terrific to the dumb
gloating of -PRON- aspect so that not the fierce fanged tiger in -PRON-
heraldic coat can so stagger courage as the white shroud bear or
shark


with reference to the polar bear -PRON- may possibly be urge by -PRON-
who would fain go still deep into this matter that -PRON- be not
the whiteness separately regard which heighten the intolerable
hideousness of that brute for analyse that heighten hideousness
-PRON- may be say only rise from the circumstance that the
irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stand invest in the
fleece of celestial innocence and love and hence by bring together
two such opposite emotion in -PRON- mind the polar bear frighten -PRON-
with so unnatural a contrast but even assume all this to be true
yet be -PRON- not for the whiteness -PRON- would not have that intensify
terror

as for the white shark the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that
creature when beheld in -PRON- ordinary mood strangely tally with the
same quality in the polar quadrup this peculiarity be most vividly
hit by the french in the name -PRON- bestow upon that fish the romish
mass for the dead begin with requiem eternam eternal rest whence
requiem denominate the mass -PRON- and any other funeral music now
in allusion to the white silent stillness of death in this shark and
the mild deadliness of -PRON- habit the french call -PRON- requin


bethink thee of the albatross whence come those cloud of spiritual
wonderment and pale dread in which that white phantom sail in all
imagination not coleridge first throw that spell but god 's great
unflattering laureate nature


-PRON- remember the first albatross -PRON- ever see -PRON- be during a prolonged
gale in water hard upon the antarctic sea from -PRON- forenoon watch
below -PRON- ascend to the overclouded deck and there dash upon the
main hatch -PRON- see a regal feathery thing of unspotted whiteness and
with a hook roman bill sublime at interval -PRON- arch forth
-PRON- vast archangel wing as if to embrace some holy ark wondrous
fluttering and throbbing shake -PRON- though bodily unharmed -PRON- utter
cry as some king 's ghost in supernatural distress through -PRON-
inexpressible strange eye methought -PRON- peep to secret which take
hold of god as abraham before the angel -PRON- bow -PRON- the white
thing be so white -PRON- wing so wide and in those for ever exile
water -PRON- have lose the miserable warping memory of tradition and of
town long -PRON- gaze at that prodigy of plumage -PRON- can not tell can only
hint the thing that dart through -PRON- then but at last -PRON- awake and
turn ask a sailor what bird be this a goney -PRON- reply goney
never have hear that name before be -PRON- conceivable that this glorious
thing be utterly unknown to man ashore never but some time after -PRON-
learn that goney be some seaman 's name for albatross so that by no
possibility could coleridge 's wild rhyme have have aught to do with those
mystical impression which be mine when -PRON- see that bird upon -PRON-
deck for neither have -PRON- then read the rhyme nor know the bird to be
an albatross yet in say this -PRON- do but indirectly burnish a little
bright the noble merit of the poem and the poet

-PRON- assert then that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird
chiefly lurk the secret of the spell a truth the more evince in this
that by a solecism of term there be bird call grey albatross
and these -PRON- have frequently see but never with such emotion as when -PRON-
beheld the antarctic fowl

but how have the mystic thing be catch whisper -PRON- not and -PRON- will
tell with a treacherous hook and line as the fowl float on the sea
at last the captain make a postman of -PRON- tie a letter leathern
tally round -PRON- neck with the ship 's time and place and then let
-PRON- escape but -PRON- doubt not that leathern tally mean for man be
take off in heaven when the white fowl fly to join the wing folding
the invoking and adore cherubim


most famous in -PRON- western annal and indian tradition be that of
the white steed of the prairies a magnificent milk white charger
large eyed small head bluff chest and with the dignity of a
thousand monarch in -PRON- lofty overscorn carriage -PRON- be the
elect xerxes of vast herd of wild horse whose pasture in those
day be only fence by the rocky mountains and the alleghanies at
-PRON- flaming head -PRON- westward troop -PRON- like that choose star which
every evening lead on the host of light the flashing cascade of -PRON-
mane the curve comet of -PRON- tail invest -PRON- with housing more
resplendent than gold and silver beater could have furnish -PRON- a
most imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen western
world which to the eye of the old trapper and hunter revive the
glory of those primeval time when adam walk majestic as a god
bluff brow and fearless as this mighty steed whether march amid
-PRON- aide and marshal in the van of countless cohort that endlessly
stream -PRON- over the plain like an ohio or whether with -PRON-
circumambient subject browse all around at the horizon the white
steed gallopingly review -PRON- with warm nostril redden through -PRON-
cool milkiness in whatev aspect -PRON- present -PRON- always to the
brave indians -PRON- be the object of tremble reverence and awe nor
can -PRON- be question from what stand on legendary record of this noble
horse that -PRON- be -PRON- spiritual whiteness chiefly which so clothe -PRON-
with divineness and that this divineness have that in -PRON- which though
command worship at the same time enforce a certain nameless terror

but there be other instance where this whiteness lose all that
accessory and strange glory which invest -PRON- in the white steed and
albatross

what be -PRON- that in the albino man so peculiarly repel and often shock
the eye as that sometimes -PRON- be loathe by -PRON- own kith and kin -PRON-
be that whiteness which invest -PRON- a thing express by the name
-PRON- bear the albino be as well make as other man have no substantive
deformity and yet this mere aspect of all pervade whiteness make -PRON-
more strangely hideous than the ugly abortion why should this be so

nor in quite other aspect do nature in -PRON- least palpable but
not the less malicious agency fail to enlist among -PRON- force
this crown attribute of the terrible from -PRON- snowy aspect the
gauntleted ghost of the southern seas have be denominate the white
squall nor in some historic instance have the art of human malice
omit so potent an auxiliary how wildly -PRON- heighten the effect of
that passage in froissart when mask in the snowy symbol of -PRON-
faction the desperate white hoods of ghent murder -PRON- bailiff in the
market place

nor in some thing do the common hereditary experience of all
mankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue -PRON-
can not well be doubt that the one visible quality in the aspect of
the dead which most appal the gazer be the marble pallor linger
there as if indeed that pallor be as much like the badge of
consternation in the other world as of mortal trepidation here and
from that pallor of the dead -PRON- borrow the expressive hue of the shroud
in which -PRON- wrap -PRON- nor even in -PRON- superstition do -PRON- fail to
throw the same snowy mantle round -PRON- phantom all ghost rise in a
milk white fog yea while these terror seize -PRON- let -PRON- add that even
the king of terror when personify by the evangelist rid on -PRON-
pallid horse

therefore in -PRON- other mood symbolize whatev grand or gracious
thing -PRON- will by whiteness no man can deny that in -PRON- profoundest
idealized significance -PRON- call up a peculiar apparition to the soul

but though without dissent this point be fix how be mortal man to
account for -PRON- to analyse -PRON- would seem impossible can -PRON- then
by the citation of some of those instance wherein this thing of
whiteness though for the time either wholly or in great part strip
of all direct association calculate to impart to -PRON- aught fearful
but nevertheless be find to exert over -PRON- the same sorcery however
modify can -PRON- thus hope to light upon some chance clue to conduct -PRON-
to the hidden cause -PRON- seek

let -PRON- try but in a matter like this subtlety appeal to subtlety
and without imagination no man can follow another into these hall and
though doubtless some at least of the imaginative impression about
to be present may have be share by most man yet few perhaps be
entirely conscious of -PRON- at the time and therefore may not be able to
recall -PRON- now

why to the man of untutored ideality who happen to be but loosely
acquaint with the peculiar character of the day do the bare mention
of whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long dreary speechless
procession of slow pace pilgrim down cast and hooded with
new fall snow or to the unread unsophisticated protestant of the
middle american states why do the pass mention of a white friar or
a white nun evoke such an eyeless statue in the soul

or what be there apart from the tradition of dungeoned warrior and
king which will not wholly account for -PRON- that make the white
tower of london tell so much more strongly on the imagination of
an untravelled american than those other storied structure -PRON-
neighbor the byward tower or even the bloody and those sublimer
tower the white mountains of new hampshire whence in peculiar mood
come that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at the bare mention of
that name while the thought of virginia 's blue ridge be full of a soft
dewy distant dreaminess or why irrespective of all latitude and
longitude do the name of the white sea exert such a spectralness
over the fancy while that of the yellow sea lull -PRON- with mortal
thought of long lacquer mild afternoon on the wave follow by
the gaudiest and yet sleepy of sunset or to choose a wholly
unsubstantial instance purely address to the fancy why in read
the old fairy tale of central europe do the tall pale man of the
hartz forest whose changeless pallor unrustlingly glide through the
green of the grove why be this phantom more terrible than all the
whoop imp of the blocksburg

nor be -PRON- altogether the remembrance of -PRON- cathedral topple
earthquake nor the stampedoe of -PRON- frantic sea nor the
tearlessness of arid sky that never rain nor the sight of -PRON- wide
field of lean spire wrench cope stone and cross all adroop
like canted yard of anchor fleet and -PRON- suburban avenue of
house wall lie over upon each other as a tossed pack of card -PRON-
be not these thing alone which make tearless lima the strange
sad city thou can'st see for lima have take the white veil and
there be a high horror in this whiteness of -PRON- woe old as pizarro
this whiteness keep -PRON- ruin for ever new admit not the cheerful
greenness of complete decay spread over -PRON- broken rampart the rigid
pallor of an apoplexy that fix -PRON- own distortion

-PRON- know that to the common apprehension this phenomenon of whiteness
be not confess to be the prime agent in exaggerate the terror of
object otherwise terrible nor to the unimaginative mind be there aught
of terror in those appearance whose awfulness to another mind almost
solely consist in this one phenomenon especially when exhibit under
any form at all approach to muteness or universality what -PRON- mean
by these two statement may perhaps be respectively elucidate by the
follow example

first the mariner when draw nigh the coast of foreign land if by
night -PRON- hear the roar of breaker start to vigilance and feel just
enough of trepidation to sharpen all -PRON- faculty but under precisely
similar circumstance let -PRON- be call from -PRON- hammock to view -PRON-
ship sail through a midnight sea of milky whiteness as if from
encircle headland shoal of comb white bear be swim round
-PRON- then -PRON- feel a silent superstitious dread the shrouded phantom
of the whiten water be horrible to -PRON- as a real ghost in vain the
lead assure -PRON- -PRON- be still off sounding heart and helm -PRON- both go
down -PRON- never rest till blue water be under -PRON- again yet where be
the mariner who will tell thee sir -PRON- be not so much the fear of
strike hidden rock as the fear of that hideous whiteness that so
stir -PRON-

second to the native indian of peru the continual sight of the
snowhowdah andes convey naught of dread except perhaps in the
mere fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reign at such vast
altitude and the natural conceit of what a fearfulness -PRON- would be
to lose oneself in such inhuman solitude much the same be -PRON- with the
backwoodsman of the west who with comparative indifference view an
unbounded prairie sheet with drive snow no shadow of tree or twig
to break the fix trance of whiteness not so the sailor behold the
scenery of the antarctic seas where at time by some infernal trick
of legerdemain in the power of frost and air -PRON- shiver and half
shipwreck instead of rainbow speak hope and solace to -PRON- misery
view what seem a boundless churchyard grin upon -PRON- with -PRON- lean
ice monument and splinter cross

but thou say methink that white lead chapter about whiteness be but
a white flag hang out from a craven soul thou surrender to a hypo
ishmael

tell -PRON- why this strong young colt foal in some peaceful valley of
vermont far removed from all beast of prey why be -PRON- that upon the
sunny day if -PRON- but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind -PRON- so that
-PRON- can not even see -PRON- but only smell -PRON- wild animal muskiness why
will -PRON- start snort and with bursting eye paw the ground in phrensie
of affright there be no remembrance in -PRON- of any goring of wild
creature in -PRON- green northern home so that the strange muskiness -PRON-
smell can not recall to -PRON- anything associate with the experience of
former peril for what know -PRON- this new england colt of the black
bison of distant oregon

no but here thou behold even in a dumb brute the instinct of the
knowledge of the demonism in the world though thousand of mile from
oregon still when -PRON- smell that savage musk the rending gore bison
herd be as present as to the desert wild foal of the prairie which
this instant -PRON- may be trample into dust

thus then the muffled rolling of a milky sea the bleak rustling
of the festooned frost of mountain the desolate shifting of the
windrow snow of prairie all these to ishmael be as the shake
of that buffalo robe to the frightened colt

though neither know where lie the nameless thing of which the mystic
sign give forth such hint yet with -PRON- as with the colt somewhere
those thing must exist though in many of -PRON- aspect this visible
world seem form in love the invisible sphere be form in fright

but not yet have -PRON- solve the incantation of this whiteness and
learn why -PRON- appeal with such power to the soul and more strange
and far more portentous why as -PRON- have see -PRON- be at once the
most meaning symbol of spiritual thing nay the very veil of the
christian 's deity and yet should be as -PRON- be the intensify agent in
thing the most appalling to mankind

be -PRON- that by -PRON- indefiniteness -PRON- shadow forth the heartless void
and immensity of the universe and thus stab -PRON- from behind with the
thought of annihilation when behold the white depth of the milky
way or be -PRON- that as in essence whiteness be not so much a colour as
the visible absence of colour and at the same time the concrete of all
colour be -PRON- for these reason that there be such a dumb blankness
full of meaning in a wide landscape of snow a colourless all colour
of atheism from which -PRON- shrink and when -PRON- consider that other theory
of the natural philosopher that all other earthly hue every stately
or lovely emblazoning the sweet tinge of sunset sky and wood yea
and the gilded velvet of butterfly and the butterfly cheek of
young girl all these be but subtile deceit not actually inherent
in substance but only lay on from without so that all deify nature
absolutely paint like the harlot whose allurement cover nothing but
the charnel house within and when -PRON- proce further and consider that
the mystical cosmetic which produce every one of -PRON- hue the great
principle of light for ever remain white or colourless in -PRON- and
if operating without medium upon matter would touch all object even
tulip and rose with -PRON- own blank tinge ponder all this the
palsied universe lie before -PRON- a leper and like wilful traveller in
lapland who refuse to wear coloured and colour glass upon -PRON-
eye so the wretched infidel gaze -PRON- blind at the monumental
white shroud that wrap all the prospect around -PRON- and of all these
thing the albino whale be the symbol wonder ye then at the fiery
hunt



chapter 43 hark


hist do -PRON- hear that noise cabaco

-PRON- be the middle watch a fair moonlight the seaman be stand in a
cordon extend from one of the fresh water butts in the waist to the
scuttle butt near the taffrail in this manner -PRON- pass the bucket
to fill the scuttle butt standing for the most part on the hallowed
precinct of the quarter deck -PRON- be careful not to speak or rustle
-PRON- foot from hand to hand the bucket go in the deep silence
only break by the occasional flap of a sail and the steady hum of the
unceasingly advance keel

-PRON- be in the midst of this repose that archy one of the cordon whose

chapter 44 the chart


have -PRON- follow captain ahab down into -PRON- cabin after the squall that
take place on the night succeed that wild ratification of -PRON- purpose
with -PRON- crew -PRON- would have see -PRON- go to a locker in the transom
and bring out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea chart spread
-PRON- before -PRON- on -PRON- screw down table then seat -PRON- before
-PRON- -PRON- would have see -PRON- intently study the various line and
shading which there meet -PRON- eye and with slow but steady pencil trace
additional course over space that before be blank at interval -PRON-
would refer to pile of old log book beside -PRON- wherein be set down
the season and place in which on various former voyage of various
ship sperm whale have be capture or see

while thus employ the heavy pewter lamp suspend in chain over -PRON-
head continually rock with the motion of the ship and for ever throw
shift gleam and shadow of line upon -PRON- wrinkled brow till -PRON-
almost seem that while -PRON- -PRON- be mark out line and course
on the wrinkled chart some invisible pencil be also trace line and
course upon the deeply mark chart of -PRON- forehead

but -PRON- be not this night in particular that in the solitude of -PRON-
cabin ahab thus ponder over -PRON- chart almost every night -PRON- be
bring out almost every night some pencil mark be efface and
other be substitute for with the chart of all four ocean before
-PRON- ahab be thread a maze of current and eddy with a view to
the more certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of -PRON- soul

now to any one not fully acquaint with the way of the leviathan
-PRON- may seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary
creature in the unhooped ocean of this planet but not so do -PRON-
seem to ahab who know the set of all tide and current and thereby
calculate the drifting of the sperm whale 's food and also call
to mind the regular ascertain season for hunt -PRON- in particular
latitude could arrive at reasonable surmise almost approach to
certainty concern the timely day to be upon this or that ground
in search of -PRON- prey

so assure indeed be the fact concern the periodicalness of the
sperm whale 's resorting to give water that many hunter believe that
could -PRON- be closely observed and study throughout the world be the
log for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully collate
then the migration of the sperm whale would be find to correspond in
invariability to those of the herring shoal or the flight of swallow
on this hint attempt have be make to construct elaborate migratory
chart of the sperm whale

since the above be write the statement be happily bear
out by an official circular issue by lieutenant maury of
the national observatory washington april 16th 1851 by
that circular -PRON- appear that precisely such a chart be in
course of completion and portion of -PRON- be present in
the circular this chart divide the ocean into district
of five degree of latitude by five degree of longitude
perpendicularly through each of which district be twelve
column for the twelve month and horizontally through each
of which district be three line one to show the number
of day that have be spend in each month in every
district and the two other to show the number of day in
which whale sperm or right have be see

besides when make a passage from one feeding ground to another the
sperm whale guide by some infallible instinct say rather secret
intelligence from the deity mostly swim in veins as -PRON- be call
continue -PRON- way along a give ocean line with such undeviating
exactitude that no ship ever sail -PRON- course by any chart with
one tithe of such marvellous precision though in these case the
direction take by any one whale be straight as a surveyor 's parallel
and though the line of advance be strictly confine to -PRON- own
unavoidable straight wake yet the arbitrary vein in which at these
time -PRON- be say to swim generally embrace some few mile in width
more or less as the vein be presume to expand or contract but
never exceed the visual sweep from the whale ship 's mast head
when circumspectly glide along this magic zone the sum be that at
particular season within that breadth and along that path migrate
whale may with great confidence be look for

and hence not only at substantiate time upon well known separate
feeding ground could ahab hope to encounter -PRON- prey but in cross
the wide expanse of water between those ground -PRON- could by -PRON-
art so place and time -PRON- on -PRON- way as even then not to be wholly
without prospect of a meeting

there be a circumstance which at first sight seem to entangle -PRON-
delirious but still methodical scheme but not so in the reality
perhaps though the gregarious sperm whale have -PRON- regular season
for particular ground yet in general -PRON- can not conclude that the
herd which haunt such and such a latitude or longitude this year
say will turn out to be identically the same with those that be find
there the precede season though there be peculiar and unquestionable
instance where the contrary of this have prove true in general the
same remark only within a less wide limit apply to the solitary
and hermit among the mature age sperm whale so that though moby
dick have in a former year be see for example on what be call the
seychelle ground in the indian ocean or volcano bay on the japanese
coast yet -PRON- do not follow that be the pequod to visit either of
those spot at any subsequent correspond season -PRON- would infallibly
encounter -PRON- there so too with some other feeding ground where
-PRON- have at time reveal -PRON- but all these seem only -PRON- casual
stop place and ocean inn so to speak not -PRON- place of prolong
abode and where ahab 's chance of accomplish -PRON- object have
hitherto be speak of allusion have only be make to whatev
way side antecedent extra prospect be -PRON- ere a particular
set time or place be attain when all possibility would become
probability and as ahab fondly think every possibility the next
thing to a certainty that particular set time and place be conjoin
in the one technical phrase the season on the line for there and then
for several consecutive year moby dick have be periodically descry
linger in those water for awhile as the sun in -PRON- annual round
loiter for a predict interval in any one sign of the zodiac there
-PRON- be too that most of the deadly encounter with the white whale have
take place there the wave be story with -PRON- deed there also be
that tragic spot where the monomaniac old man have find the awful motive
to -PRON- vengeance but in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloiter
vigilance with which ahab throw -PRON- brooding soul into this unfaltering
hunt -PRON- would not permit -PRON- to rest all -PRON- hope upon the one
crown fact above mention however flatter -PRON- may be to those
hope nor in the sleeplessness of -PRON- vow could -PRON- so tranquillize -PRON-
unquiet heart as to postpone all intervene quest

now the pequod have sail from nantucket at the very beginning of the
season on the line no possible endeavor then could enable -PRON- commander
to make the great passage southward double cape horn and then run
down sixty degree of latitude arrive in the equatorial pacific in time
to cruise there therefore -PRON- must wait for the next ensue season
yet the premature hour of the pequod 's sailing have perhaps be
correctly select by ahab with a view to this very complexion of
thing because an interval of three hundred and sixty five day
and night be before -PRON- an interval which instead of impatiently
endure ashore -PRON- would spend in a miscellaneous hunt if by chance
the white whale spend -PRON- vacation in sea far remote from -PRON-
periodical feed ground should turn up -PRON- wrinkled brow off the
persian gulf or in the bengal bay or china seas or in any other
water haunt by -PRON- race so that monsoons pampas nor'-wester
harmattans trades any wind but the levanter and simoon may
blow moby dick into the devious zig zag world circle of the pequod 's
circumnavigate wake

but grant all this yet regard discreetly and coolly seem -PRON- not
but a mad idea this that in the broad boundless ocean one solitary
whale even if encounter should be think capable of individual
recognition from -PRON- hunter even as a white bearded mufti in the
throng thoroughfare of constantinople yes for the peculiar
snow white brow of moby dick and -PRON- snow white hump could not but
be unmistakable and have -PRON- not tally the whale ahab would mutter
to -PRON- as after pore over -PRON- chart till long after midnight -PRON-
would throw -PRON- back in reverie tally -PRON- and shall -PRON- escape
-PRON- broad fin be bored and scallop out like a lost sheep 's ear and
here -PRON- mad mind would run on in a breathless race till a weariness
and faintness of ponder come over -PRON- and in the open air of the
deck -PRON- would seek to recover -PRON- strength ah god what trance
of torment do that man endure who be consume with one unachieved
revengeful desire -PRON- sleep with clenched hand and wake with -PRON- own
bloody nail in -PRON- palm

often when force from -PRON- hammock by exhaust and intolerably vivid
dream of the night which resume -PRON- own intense thought through
the day carry -PRON- on amid a clashing of phrensie and whirl -PRON-
round and round and round in -PRON- blaze brain till the very throbbing
of -PRON- life spot become insufferable anguish and when as be sometimes
the case these spiritual throe in -PRON- heave -PRON- be up from -PRON-
base and a chasm seem open in -PRON- from which fork flame and
lightning shoot up and accursed fiend beckon -PRON- to leap down among
-PRON- when this hell in -PRON- yawn beneath -PRON- a wild cry would be
hear through the ship and with glaring eye ahab would burst from -PRON-
state room as though escape from a bed that be on fire yet these
perhaps instead of be the unsuppressable symptom of some latent
weakness or fright at -PRON- own resolve be but the plainest token
of -PRON- intensity for at such time crazy ahab the scheming
unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the white whale this ahab that have
go to -PRON- hammock be not the agent that so cause -PRON- to burst from
-PRON- in horror again the latter be the eternal live principle or
soul in -PRON- and in sleep be for the time dissociate from the
characterize mind which at other time employ -PRON- for -PRON- outer
vehicle or agent -PRON- spontaneously seek escape from the scorch
contiguity of the frantic thing of which for the time -PRON- be no
longer an integral but as the mind do not exist unless league with
the soul therefore -PRON- must have be that in ahab 's case yield up
all -PRON- thought and fancy to -PRON- one supreme purpose that purpose
by -PRON- own sheer inveteracy of will force -PRON- against god and
devil into a kind of self assume independent being of -PRON- own nay
could grimly live and burn while the common vitality to which -PRON- be
conjoin flee horror stricken from the unbidden and unfathered birth
therefore the tormented spirit that glare out of bodily eye when
what seem ahab rush from -PRON- room be for the time but a vacate
thing a formless somnambulistic being a ray of live light to be
sure but without an object to colour and therefore a blankness in
-PRON- god help thee old man thy thought have create a creature
in thee and -PRON- whose intense thinking thus make -PRON- a prometheus a
vulture feed upon that heart for ever that vulture the very creature
-PRON- create



chapter 45 the affidavit


so far as what there may be of a narrative in this book and indeed as
indirectly touch one or two very interesting and curious particular
in the habit of sperm whale the forego chapter in -PRON- early
part be as important a one as will be find in this volume but the
lead matter of -PRON- require to be still further and more familiarly
enlarge upon in order to be adequately understand and moreover to
take away any incredulity which a profound ignorance of the entire
subject may induce in some mind as to the natural verity of the main
point of this affair

-PRON- care not to perform this part of -PRON- task methodically but shall
be content to produce the desire impression by separate citation of
item practically or reliably know to -PRON- as a whaleman and from these
citation -PRON- take -PRON- the conclusion aim at will naturally follow of
-PRON-

first -PRON- have personally know three instance where a whale after
receive a harpoon have effect a complete escape and after an
interval in one instance of three year have be again strike by
the same hand and slay when the two iron both mark by the same
private cypher have be take from the body in the instance where
three year intervene between the flinging of the two harpoon and -PRON-
think -PRON- may have be something more than that the man who dart
-PRON- happen in the interval to go in a trading ship on a voyage to
africa go ashore there join a discovery party and penetrate far
into the interior where -PRON- travel for a period of nearly two year
often endanger by serpent savage tiger poisonous miasma
with all the other common peril incident to wander in the heart of
unknown region meanwhile the whale -PRON- have strike must also have
be on -PRON- travel no doubt -PRON- have thrice circumnavigate the globe
brush with -PRON- flank all the coast of africa but to no purpose
this man and this whale again come together and the one vanquish the
other -PRON- say -PRON- -PRON- have know three instance similar to this that
be in two of -PRON- -PRON- see the whale strike and upon the second attack
see the two iron with the respective mark cut in -PRON- afterwards
take from the dead fish in the three year instance -PRON- so fall out
that -PRON- be in the boat both time first and last and the last time
distinctly recognise a peculiar sort of huge mole under the whale 's
eye which -PRON- have observe there three year previous -PRON- say three year
but -PRON- be pretty sure -PRON- be more than that here be three instance
then which -PRON- personally know the truth of but -PRON- have hear of many
other instance from person whose veracity in the matter there be no
good ground to impeach

secondly -PRON- be well know in the sperm whale fishery however ignorant
the world ashore may be of -PRON- that there have be several memorable
historical instance where a particular whale in the ocean have be at
distant time and place popularly cognisable why such a whale become
thus mark be not altogether and originally owe to -PRON- bodily
peculiarity as distinguish from other whale for however peculiar
in that respect any chance whale may be -PRON- soon put an end to -PRON-
peculiarity by kill -PRON- and boil -PRON- down into a peculiarly
valuable oil no the reason be this that from the fatal experience
of the fishery there hang a terrible prestige of perilousness about
such a whale as there do about rinaldo rinaldini insomuch that
most fisherman be content to recognise -PRON- by merely touch -PRON-
tarpaulin when -PRON- would be discover lounge by -PRON- on the sea
without seek to cultivate a more intimate acquaintance like some
poor devil ashore that happen to know an irascible great man -PRON-
make distant unobtrusive salutation to -PRON- in the street lest if -PRON-
pursue the acquaintance further -PRON- may receive a summary thump for
-PRON- presumption

but not only do each of these famous whale enjoy great individual
celebrity nay -PRON- may call -PRON- an ocean wide renown not only be -PRON-
famous in life and now be immortal in forecastle story after death
but -PRON- be admit into all the right privilege and distinction of
a name have as much a name indeed as cambyses or caesar be -PRON- not so
o timor tom thou famed leviathan scar like an iceberg who so long
did'st lurk in the oriental strait of that name whose spout be oft
see from the palmy beach of ombay be -PRON- not so o new zealand jack
thou terror of all cruiser that cross -PRON- wake in the vicinity of
the tattoo land be -PRON- not so o morquan king of japan whose lofty
jet -PRON- say at time assume the semblance of a snow white cross
against the sky be -PRON- not so o don miguel thou chilian whale mark
like an old tortoise with mystic hieroglyphic upon the back in plain
prose here be four whale as well know to the student of cetacean
history as marius or sylla to the classic scholar

but this be not all new zealand tom and don miguel after at various
time create great havoc among the boat of different vessel be
finally go in quest of systematically hunt out chase and kill
by valiant whaling captain who heave up -PRON- anchor with
that express object as much in view as in set out through the
narragansett woods captain butler of old have -PRON- in -PRON- mind to capture
that notorious murderous savage annawon the headmost warrior of the
indian king philip

-PRON- do not know where -PRON- can find a good place than just here to make
mention of one or two other thing which to -PRON- seem important as in
print form establish in all respect the reasonableness of the
whole story of the white whale more especially the catastrophe for
this be one of those disheartening instance where truth require full
as much bolstering as error so ignorant be most landsman of some of
the plainest and most palpable wonder of the world that without
some hint touch the plain fact historical and otherwise of the
fishery -PRON- may scout at moby dick as a monstrous fable or still
bad and more detestable a hideous and intolerable allegory

first though most man have some vague flitting idea of the general
peril of the grand fishery yet -PRON- have nothing like a fix vivid
conception of those peril and the frequency with which -PRON- recur
one reason perhaps be that not one in fifty of the actual disaster and
death by casualty in the fishery ever find a public record at home
however transient and immediately forget that record do -PRON- suppose
that that poor fellow there who this moment perhaps catch by the
whale line off the coast of new guinea be be carry down to the
bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathan do -PRON- suppose that that
poor fellow 's name will appear in the newspaper obituary -PRON- will read
to morrow at -PRON- breakfast no because the mail be very irregular
between here and new guinea in fact do -PRON- ever hear what may be
call regular news direct or indirect from new guinea yet -PRON- tell -PRON-
that upon one particular voyage which -PRON- make to the pacific among many
other -PRON- speak thirty different ship every one of which have have a
death by a whale some of -PRON- more than one and three that have each
lose a boat 's crew for god 's sake be economical with -PRON- lamp and
candle not a gallon -PRON- burn but at least one drop of man 's blood be
spill for -PRON-

secondly people ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale be
an enormous creature of enormous power but -PRON- have ever find that when
narrate to -PRON- some specific example of this two fold enormousness
-PRON- have significantly compliment -PRON- upon -PRON- facetiousness when -PRON-
declare upon -PRON- soul -PRON- have no more idea of be facetious than moses
when -PRON- write the history of the plague of egypt

but fortunately the special point -PRON- here seek can be establish upon
testimony entirely independent of -PRON- own that point be this the sperm
whale be in some case sufficiently powerful know and judiciously
malicious as with direct aforethought to stave in utterly destroy and
sink a large ship and what be more the sperm whale has do -PRON-

first in the year 1820 the ship essex captain pollard of nantucket
be cruise in the pacific ocean one day -PRON- see spout lower -PRON-
boat and give chase to a shoal of sperm whale ere long several of
the whale be wound when suddenly a very large whale escape
from the boat issue from the shoal and bear directly down upon the
ship dash -PRON- forehead against -PRON- hull -PRON- so stove -PRON- in that in
less than ten minute -PRON- settle down and fall over not a survive
plank of -PRON- have be see since after the severe exposure part of
the crew reach the land in -PRON- boat be return home at last
captain pollard once more sail for the pacific in command of another
ship but the god shipwreck -PRON- again upon unknown rock and
breaker for the second time -PRON- ship be utterly lose and forthwith
forswear the sea -PRON- have never tempt -PRON- since at this day captain
pollard be a resident of nantucket -PRON- have see owen chace who be
chief mate of the essex at the time of the tragedy -PRON- have read -PRON-
plain and faithful narrative -PRON- have converse with -PRON- son and all
this within a few mile of the scene of the catastrophe


the follow be extract from chace 's narrative every fact seem
to warrant -PRON- in conclude that -PRON- be anything but chance which
direct -PRON- operation -PRON- make two several attack upon the ship at
a short interval between -PRON- both of which accord to -PRON-
direction be calculate to do -PRON- the most injury by be make
ahead and thereby combine the speed of the two object for the shock
to effect which the exact manoeuvre which -PRON- make be necessary -PRON-
aspect be most horrible and such as indicated resentment and fury -PRON-
come directly from the shoal which -PRON- have just before enter and in
which -PRON- have strike three of -PRON- companion as if fire with revenge
for -PRON- suffering again at all event the whole circumstance
take together all happen before -PRON- own eye and produce at the
time impression in -PRON- mind of decide calculate mischief on the
part of the whale many of which impression -PRON- can not now recall
induce -PRON- to be satisfied that -PRON- be correct in -PRON- opinion

here be -PRON- reflection some time after quit the ship during
a black night in an open boat when almost despairing of reach any
hospitable shore the dark ocean and swell water be nothing the
fear of be swallow up by some dreadful tempest or dash
upon hide rock with all the other ordinary subject of fearful
contemplation seem scarcely entitled to a moment 's thought the
dismal look wreck and the horrid aspect and revenge of the whale
wholly engross -PRON- reflection until day again make -PRON- appearance

in another place p 45,--he speak of the mysterious and mortal attack
of the animal


secondly the ship union also of nantucket be in the year 1807
totally lose off the azores by a similar onset but the authentic
particular of this catastrophe -PRON- have never chance to encounter
though from the whale hunter -PRON- have now and then hear casual allusion
to -PRON-

thirdly some eighteen or twenty year ago commodore j--- then
command an american sloop of war of the first class happen to be
dining with a party of whaling captain on board a nantucket ship in
the harbor of oahu sandwich islands conversation turn upon whale
the commodore be pleased to be sceptical touch the amazing strength
ascribe to -PRON- by the professional gentleman present -PRON- peremptorily
deny for example that any whale could so smite -PRON- stout sloop of war
as to cause -PRON- to leak so much as a thimbleful very good but there
be more come some week after the commodore set sail in this
impregnable craft for valparaiso but -PRON- be stop on the way by a
portly sperm whale that beg a few moment confidential business
with -PRON- that business consist in fetch the commodore 's craft such
a thwack that with all -PRON- pump go -PRON- make straight for the near
port to heave down and repair -PRON- be not superstitious but -PRON- consider
the commodore 's interview with that whale as providential be not saul
of tarsus convert from unbelief by a similar fright -PRON- tell -PRON- the
sperm whale will stand no nonsense

-PRON- will now refer -PRON- to langsdorff 's voyage for a little circumstance
in point peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof langsdorff -PRON-
must know by the way be attach to the russian admiral krusenstern 's
famous discovery expedition in the beginning of the present century
captain langsdorff thus begin -PRON- seventeenth chapter

by the thirteenth of may -PRON- ship be ready to sail and the next day
-PRON- be out in the open sea on -PRON- way to ochotsh the weather be very
clear and fine but so intolerably cold that -PRON- be oblige to keep on
-PRON- fur clothing for some day -PRON- have very little wind -PRON- be not
till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest spring up an
uncommon large whale the body of which be large than the ship -PRON-
lie almost at the surface of the water but be not perceive by any
one on board till the moment when the ship which be in full sail
be almost upon -PRON- so that -PRON- be impossible to prevent -PRON- striking
against -PRON- -PRON- be thus place in the most imminent danger as this
gigantic creature set up -PRON- back raise the ship three foot at
least out of the water the mast reel and the sail fall altogether
while -PRON- who be below all spring instantly upon the deck conclude
that -PRON- have strike upon some rock instead of this -PRON- see the monster
sailing off with the utmost gravity and solemnity captain d'wolf
apply immediately to the pump to examine whether or not the vessel
have receive any damage from the shock but -PRON- find that very happily
-PRON- have escape entirely uninjured

now the captain d'wolf here allude to as command the ship in
question be a new englander who after a long life of unusual
adventure as a sea captain this day reside in the village of
dorchester near boston -PRON- have the honour of be a nephew of -PRON- -PRON-
have particularly question -PRON- concern this passage in langsdorff
-PRON- substantiate every word the ship however be by no mean a large
one a russian craft build on the siberian coast and purchase by -PRON-
uncle after barter away the vessel in which -PRON- sail from home

in that up and down manly book of old fashioned adventure so full too
of honest wonder the voyage of lionel wafer one of ancient dampier 's
old chum -PRON- find a little matter set down so like that just quote
from langsdorff that -PRON- can not forbear insert -PRON- here for a
corroborative example if such be need

lionel -PRON- seem be on -PRON- way to john ferdinando as -PRON- call
the modern juan fernandes in -PRON- way thither -PRON- say about four
o'clock in the morning when -PRON- be about one hundred and fifty league
from the main of america -PRON- ship feel a terrible shock which put -PRON-
man in such consternation that -PRON- could hardly tell where -PRON- be
or what to think but every one begin to prepare for death and indeed
the shock be so sudden and violent that -PRON- take -PRON- for grant the
ship have strike against a rock but when the amazement be a little
over -PRON- cast the lead and sound but find no ground the
suddenness of the shock make the gun leap in -PRON- carriage and
several of the man be shake out of -PRON- hammock captain davis who
lay with -PRON- head on a gun be throw out of -PRON- cabin lionel then
go on to impute the shock to an earthquake and seem to substantiate
the imputation by state that a great earthquake somewhere about
that time do actually do great mischief along the spanish land but
-PRON- should not much wonder if in the darkness of that early hour of the
morning the shock be after all cause by an unseen whale vertically
bump the hull from beneath

-PRON- may proceed with several more example one way or another know to
-PRON- of the great power and malice at time of the sperm whale in more
than one instance -PRON- have be know not only to chase the assail
boat back to -PRON- ship but to pursue the ship -PRON- and long
withstand all the lance hurl at -PRON- from -PRON- deck the english ship
pusie hall can tell a story on that head and as for -PRON- strength
let -PRON- say that there have be example where the line attach to a
run sperm whale have in a calm be transfer to the ship and
secure there the whale tow -PRON- great hull through the water as a
horse walk off with a cart again -PRON- be very often observe that if
the sperm whale once strike be allow time to rally -PRON- then act
not so often with blind rage as with wilful deliberate design of
destruction to -PRON- pursuer nor be -PRON- without convey some eloquent
indication of -PRON- character that upon be attack -PRON- will frequently
open -PRON- mouth and retain -PRON- in that dread expansion for several
consecutive minute but -PRON- must be content with only one more and a
conclude illustration a remarkable and most significant one by which
-PRON- will not fail to see that not only be the most marvellous event in
this book corroborate by plain fact of the present day but that these
marvel like all marvel be mere repetition of the age so that for
the millionth time -PRON- say aman with solomon verily there be nothing new
under the sun

in the sixth christian century live procopius a christian magistrate
of constantinople in the day when justinian be emperor and belisarius
general as many know -PRON- write the history of -PRON- own time a work
every way of uncommon value by the good authority -PRON- have always be
consider a most trustworthy and unexaggerating historian except in
some one or two particular not at all affect the matter presently
to be mention

now in this history of -PRON- procopius mention that during the term
of -PRON- prefecture at constantinople a great sea monster be capture
in the neighboring propontis or sea of marmora after have destroy
vessel at interval in those water for a period of more than fifty
year a fact thus set down in substantial history can not easily be
gainsaid nor be there any reason -PRON- should be of what precise specie
this sea monster be be not mention but as -PRON- destroy ship as
well as for other reason -PRON- must have be a whale and -PRON- be strongly
inclined to think a sperm whale and -PRON- will tell -PRON- why for a long
time -PRON- fancy that the sperm whale have be always unknown in the
mediterranean and the deep water connect with -PRON- even now -PRON- be
certain that those sea be not and perhaps never can be in the
present constitution of thing a place for -PRON- habitual gregarious
resort but further investigation have recently prove to -PRON- that in
modern time there have be isolated instance of the presence of the
sperm whale in the mediterranean -PRON- be tell on good authority that
on the barbary coast a commodore davis of the british navy find
the skeleton of a sperm whale now as a vessel of war readily pass
through the dardanelle hence a sperm whale could by the same route
pass out of the mediterranean into the propontis

in the propontis as far as -PRON- can learn none of that peculiar substance
call brit be to be find the aliment of the right whale but -PRON- have
every reason to believe that the food of the sperm whale squid or
cuttle fish lurk at the bottom of that sea because large creature
but by no mean the large of that sort have be find at -PRON-
surface if then -PRON- properly put these statement together and
reason upon -PRON- a bit -PRON- will clearly perceive that accord to all
human reasoning procopius 's sea monster that for half a century stove
the ship of a roman emperor must in all probability have be a sperm
whale



chapter 46 surmise


though consume with the hot fire of -PRON- purpose ahab in all -PRON-
thought and action ever have in view the ultimate capture of moby dick
though -PRON- seem ready to sacrifice all mortal interest to that one
passion nevertheless -PRON- may have be that -PRON- be by nature and long
habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman 's way altogether to
abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage or at least if
this be otherwise there be not want other motif much more
influential with -PRON- -PRON- would be refine too much perhaps even
consider -PRON- monomania to hint that -PRON- vindictiveness towards the
white whale may have possibly extend -PRON- in some degree to all
sperm whale and that the more monster -PRON- slay by so much the more -PRON-
multiply the chance that each subsequently encounter whale would
prove to be the hat one -PRON- hunt but if such an hypothesis be indeed
exceptionable there be still additional consideration which though
not so strictly accord with the wildness of -PRON- ruling passion yet
be by no mean incapable of sway -PRON-

to accomplish -PRON- object ahab must use tool and of all tool use in
the shadow of the moon man be most apt to get out of order -PRON- know
for example that however magnetic -PRON- ascendency in some respect be
over starbuck yet that ascendency do not cover the complete spiritual
man any more than mere corporeal superiority involve intellectual
mastership for to the purely spiritual the intellectual but stand in a
sort of corporeal relation starbuck 's body and starbuck 's coerce will
be ahab 's so long as ahab keep -PRON- magnet at starbuck 's brain still
-PRON- know that for all this the chief mate in -PRON- soul abhor -PRON-
captain 's quest and could -PRON- would joyfully disintegrate -PRON- from
-PRON- or even frustrate -PRON- -PRON- may be that a long interval would elapse
ere the white whale be see during that long interval starbuck
would ever be apt to fall into open relapse of rebellion against -PRON-
captain 's leadership unless some ordinary prudential circumstantial
influence be bring to bear upon -PRON- not only that but the subtle
insanity of ahab respect moby dick be noways more significantly
manifest than in -PRON- superlative sense and shrewdness in foresee
that for the present the hunt should in some way be strip of that
strange imaginative impiousness which naturally invest -PRON- that
the full terror of the voyage must be keep withdraw into the obscure
background for few man 's courage be proof against protracted meditation
unrelieved by action that when -PRON- stand -PRON- long night watch
-PRON- officer and man must have some nearer thing to think of than moby
dick for however eagerly and impetuously the savage crew have hail the
announcement of -PRON- quest yet all sailor of all sort be more or less
capricious and unreliable -PRON- live in the vary outer weather and
-PRON- inhale -PRON- fickleness and when retain for any object remote and
blank in the pursuit however promissory of life and passion in the
end -PRON- be above all thing requisite that temporary interest and
employment should intervene and hold -PRON- healthily suspend for the
final dash

nor be ahab unmindful of another thing in time of strong emotion
mankind disdain all base consideration but such time be evanescent
the permanent constitutional condition of the manufacture man think
ahab be sordidness grant that the white whale fully incite the
heart of this -PRON- savage crew and playing round -PRON- savageness even
breed a certain generous knight errantism in -PRON- still while for the
love of -PRON- -PRON- give chase to moby dick -PRON- must also have food
for -PRON- more common daily appetite for even the high lift and
chivalric crusaders of old time be not content to traverse two
thousand mile of land to fight for -PRON- holy sepulchre without
commit burglary pick pocket and gain other pious
perquisite by the way have -PRON- be strictly hold to -PRON- one final
and romantic object that final and romantic object too many would have
turn from in disgust -PRON- will not strip these man think ahab of all
hope of cash aye cash -PRON- may scorn cash now but let some month
go by and no perspective promise of -PRON- to -PRON- and then this same
quiescent cash all at once mutiny in -PRON- this same cash would soon
cashier ahab

nor be there want still another precautionary motive more related
to ahab personally have impulsively -PRON- be probable and perhaps
somewhat prematurely reveal the prime but private purpose of the
pequod 's voyage ahab be now entirely conscious that in so do
-PRON- have indirectly lay -PRON- open to the unanswerable charge of
usurpation and with perfect impunity both moral and legal -PRON- crew
if so disposed and to that end competent could refuse all further
obedience to -PRON- and even violently wr from -PRON- the command from
even the barely hint imputation of usurpation and the possible
consequence of such a suppressed impression gain ground ahab must
of course have be most anxious to protect -PRON- that protection
could only consist in -PRON- own predominating brain and heart and hand
back by a heedful closely calculate attention to every minute
atmospheric influence which -PRON- be possible for -PRON- crew to be subject
to

for all these reason then and other perhaps too analytic to be
verbally develop here ahab plainly see that -PRON- must still in a good
degree continue true to the natural nominal purpose of the pequod 's
voyage observe all customary usage and not only that but force
-PRON- to evince all -PRON- well known passionate interest in the general
pursuit of -PRON- profession

be all this as -PRON- may -PRON- voice be now often hear hail the three
mast head and admonish -PRON- to keep a bright look out and not omit
report even a porpoise this vigilance be not long without reward



chapter 47 the mat maker


-PRON- be a cloudy sultry afternoon the seaman be lazily lounge
about the deck or vacantly gaze over into the lead coloured water
queequeg and -PRON- be mildly employ weave what be call a sword mat
for an additional lashing to -PRON- boat so still and subdued and yet
somehow preluding be all the scene and such an incantation of reverie
lurk in the air that each silent sailor seem resolve into -PRON- own
invisible self

-PRON- be the attendant or page of queequeg while busy at the mat as -PRON-
keep pass and repass the filling or woof of marline between
the long yarn of the warp use -PRON- own hand for the shuttle and as
queequeg stand sideways ever and anon slide -PRON- heavy oaken sword
between the thread and idly look off upon the water carelessly and
unthinkingly drive home every yarn -PRON- say so strange a dreaminess do
there then reign all over the ship and all over the sea only break by
the intermit dull sound of the sword that -PRON- seem as if this be
the loom of time and -PRON- -PRON- be a shuttle mechanically weave
and weave away at the fates there lie the fixed thread of the warp
subject to but one single ever return unchang vibration and
that vibration merely enough to admit of the crosswise interblend
of other thread with -PRON- own this warp seem necessity and here
think -PRON- with -PRON- own hand -PRON- ply -PRON- own shuttle and weave -PRON- own
destiny into these unalterable thread meantime queequeg 's impulsive
indifferent sword sometimes hit the woof slantingly or crookedly
or strongly or weakly as the case may be and by this difference
in the conclude blow produce a correspond contrast in the final
aspect of the complete fabric this savage 's sword think -PRON-
which thus finally shape and fashion both warp and woof this
easy indifferent sword must be chance aye chance free will and
necessity nowise incompatible all interweavingly work together
the straight warp of necessity not to be swerve from -PRON- ultimate
course -PRON- every alternating vibration indeed only tend to that
free will still free to ply -PRON- shuttle between give thread and
chance though restrain in -PRON- play within the right line of
necessity and sideways in -PRON- motion direct by free will though
thus prescribe to by both chance by turn rule either and have the
last feature blow at event


thus -PRON- be weave and weave away when -PRON- start at a sound so
strange long draw and musically wild and unearthly that the ball
of free will drop from -PRON- hand and -PRON- stand gaze up at the cloud
whence that voice drop like a wing high aloft in the cross tree be
that mad gay header tashtego -PRON- body be reach eagerly forward
-PRON- hand stretch out like a wand and at brief sudden interval -PRON-
continue -PRON- cry to be sure the same sound be that very moment
perhaps be hear all over the sea from hundred of whaleman 's
look out perch as high in the air but from few of those lung could
that accustomed old cry have derive such a marvellous cadence as from
tashtego the indian 's

as -PRON- stand hover over -PRON- half suspend in air so wildly and
eagerly peer towards the horizon -PRON- would have think -PRON- some
prophet or seer behold the shadow of fate and by those wild cry
announce -PRON- coming

there -PRON- blow there there there -PRON- blow -PRON- blow

where away

on the lee beam about two mile off a school of -PRON-

instantly all be commotion

the sperm whale blow as a clock tick with the same undeviating and
reliable uniformity and thereby whaleman distinguish this fish from
other tribe of -PRON- genus

there go fluke be now the cry from tashtego and the whale
disappear

quick steward cry ahab time time

dough boy hurry below glance at the watch and report the exact
minute to ahab

the ship be now keep away from the wind and -PRON- go gently roll
before -PRON- tashtego report that the whale have go down head to
leeward -PRON- confidently look to see -PRON- again directly in advance of
-PRON- bow for that singular craft at time evince by the sperm whale
when sound with -PRON- head in one direction -PRON- nevertheless while
conceal beneath the surface mill round and swiftly swim off in the
opposite quarter this deceitfulness of -PRON- could not now be in action
for there be no reason to suppose that the fish see by tashtego have
be in any way alarm or indeed know at all of -PRON- vicinity one of
the man select for shipkeeper that be those not appoint to the
boat by this time relieve the indian at the main mast head the
sailor at the fore and mizzen have come down the line tub be fix
in -PRON- place the crane be thrust out the mainyard be back
and the three boat swing over the sea like three samphire basket over
high cliff outside of the bulwark -PRON- eager crew with one hand
clung to the rail while one foot be expectantly poise on the gunwale
so look the long line of man of war 's man about to throw -PRON- on
board an enemy 's ship

but at this critical instant a sudden exclamation be hear that take
every eye from the whale with a start all glare at dark ahab who be
surround by five dusky phantom that seem fresh form out of air



chapter 48 the first lowering


the phantom for so -PRON- then seem be flit on the other side
of the deck and with a noiseless celerity be cast loose the
tackle and band of the boat which swing there this boat have always
be deem one of the spare boat though technically call the
captain 's on account of -PRON- hang from the starboard quarter the
figure that now stand by -PRON- bow be tall and swart with one white
tooth evilly protrude from -PRON- steel like lip a rumpled chinese
jacket of black cotton funereally invest -PRON- with wide black trowser
of the same dark stuff but strangely crown this ebonness be a
glisten white plait turban the live hair braid and coil
round and round upon -PRON- head less swart in aspect the companion of
this figure be of that vivid tiger yellow complexion peculiar to
some of the aboriginal native of the manillas a race notorious for
a certain diabolism of subtilty and by some honest white mariner
suppose to be the pay spy and secret confidential agent on the
water of the devil -PRON- lord whose counting room -PRON- suppose to be
elsewhere

while yet the wondering ship 's company be gaze upon these stranger
ahab cry out to the white turbaned old man at -PRON- head all ready
there fedallah

ready be the half hiss reply

lower away then d'ye hear shout across the deck lower away
there -PRON- say

such be the thunder of -PRON- voice that spite of -PRON- amazement the man
spring over the rail the sheaf whirl round in the block with a
wallow the three boat drop into the sea while with a dexterous
off handed daring unknown in any other vocation the sailor
goat like leap down the rolling ship 's side into the toss boat
below

hardly have -PRON- pull out from under the ship 's lee when a fourth
keel come from the windward side pull round under the stern and
show the five stranger row ahab who stand erect in the stern
loudly hail starbuck stubb and flask to spread -PRON- widely
so as to cover a large expanse of water but with all -PRON- eye again
rivet upon the swart fedallah and -PRON- crew the inmate of the other
boat obey not the command

captain ahab?-- say starbuck

spread yourself cry ahab give way all four boat thou flask
pull out more to leeward

aye aye sir cheerily cry little king post sweeping round
-PRON- great steering oar lay back address -PRON- crew
there!--there!--there again there -PRON- blow right ahead boys!--lay
back

never heed yonder yellow boy archy

oh -PRON- do not mind'em sir say archy -PRON- know -PRON- all before now
do not -PRON- hear 'em in the hold and do not -PRON- tell cabaco here of -PRON- what
say ye cabaco -PRON- be stowaway mr. flask

pull pull -PRON- fine heart alive pull -PRON- child pull -PRON- little
one drawlingly and soothingly sigh stubb to -PRON- crew some of whom
still show sign of uneasiness why do not -PRON- break -PRON- backbone
-PRON- boy what be -PRON- -PRON- stare at those chap in yonder boat tut -PRON-
be only five more hand come to help -PRON- never mind from where the
more the merrier pull then do pull never mind the brimstone devil
be good fellow enough so so there -PRON- be now that be the stroke
for a thousand pound that be the stroke to sweep the stake hurrah
for the gold cup of sperm oil -PRON- hero three cheer man all heart
alive easy easy do not be in a hurry don't be in a hurry why do not
-PRON- snap -PRON- oar -PRON- rascal bite something -PRON- dog so so so
then softly softly that be -PRON- that be -PRON- long and strong give way
there give way the devil fetch ye ye ragamuffin rapscallion ye be
all asleep stop snoring ye sleeper and pull pull will ye pull
can not ye pull will not ye why in the name of gudgeon and ginger cake
do not ye pull pull and break something pull and start -PRON- eye out
here whip out the sharp knife from -PRON- girdle every mother 's son
of ye draw -PRON- knife and pull with the blade between -PRON- tooth that be
-PRON- that be -PRON- now ye do something that look like -PRON- -PRON- steel bit
start -PRON- start -PRON- -PRON- silver spoon start -PRON- marl spike

stubb 's exordium to -PRON- crew be give here at large because -PRON- have
rather a peculiar way of talk to -PRON- in general and especially in
inculcate the religion of rowing but -PRON- must not suppose from this
specimen of -PRON- sermonizing that -PRON- ever fly into downright passion
with -PRON- congregation not at all and therein consist -PRON- chief
peculiarity -PRON- would say the most terrific thing to -PRON- crew in a
tone so strangely compound of fun and fury and the fury seem so
calculate merely as a spice to the fun that no oarsman could hear such
queer invocation without pull for dear life and yet pull for
the mere joke of the thing besides -PRON- all the time look so easy and
indolent -PRON- so loungingly manage -PRON- steering oar and so broadly
gaped open mouthed at time that the mere sight of such a yawning
commander by sheer force of contrast act like a charm upon the crew
then again stubb be one of those odd sort of humorist whose jollity
be sometimes so curiously ambiguous as to put all inferior on -PRON-
guard in the matter of obey -PRON-

in obedience to a sign from ahab starbuck be now pull obliquely
across stubb 's bow and when for a minute or so the two boat be
pretty near to each other stubb hail the mate

mr. starbuck larboard boat there ahoy a word with ye sir if ye
please

halloa return starbuck turn round not a single inch as -PRON-
speak still earnestly but whisperingly urge -PRON- crew -PRON- face set
like a flint from stubb 's

what think ye of those yellow boy sir

smuggle on board somehow before the ship sail strong strong
boy in a whisper to -PRON- crew then speak out loud again a sad
business mr. stubb seethe -PRON- seethe -PRON- -PRON- lad but never mind
mr. stubb all for the good let all -PRON- crew pull strong come what
will spring -PRON- man spring there be hogshead of sperm ahead mr.
stubb and that be what ye come for pull -PRON- boy sperm sperm be the
play this at least be duty duty and profit hand in hand

aye aye -PRON- think as much soliloquize stubb when the boat
diverge as soon as -PRON- clapt eye on 'em -PRON- think so aye and that be
what -PRON- go into the after hold for so often as dough boy long
suspect -PRON- be hide down there the white whale 's at the bottom
of -PRON- well well so be -PRON- can not be help all right give way man
-PRON- be not the white whale to day give way

now the advent of these outlandish stranger at such a critical instant
as the lowering of the boat from the deck this have not unreasonably
awaken a sort of superstitious amazement in some of the ship 's
company but archy 's fancy discovery have some time previous get
abroad among -PRON- though indeed not credit then this have in some
small measure prepare -PRON- for the event -PRON- take off the extreme edge
of -PRON- wonder and so what with all this and stubb 's confident way
of accounting for -PRON- appearance -PRON- be for the time free from
superstitious surmising though the affair still leave abundant room for
all manner of wild conjecture as to dark ahab 's precise agency in the
matter from the beginning for -PRON- -PRON- silently recall the mysterious
shadow -PRON- have see creep on board the pequod during the dim nantucket
dawn as well as the enigmatical hinting of the unaccountable elijah

meantime ahab out of hearing of -PRON- officer have side the
furthest to windward be still range ahead of the other boat a
circumstance bespeak how potent a crew be pull -PRON- those tiger
yellow creature of -PRON- seem all steel and whalebone like five
trip hammer -PRON- rise and fall with regular stroke of strength which
periodically start the boat along the water like a horizontal burst
boiler out of a mississippi steamer as for fedallah who be see
pull the harpooneer oar -PRON- have throw aside -PRON- black jacket and
display -PRON- naked chest with the whole part of -PRON- body above the
gunwale clearly cut against the alternating depression of the watery
horizon while at the other end of the boat ahab with one arm like a
fencer 's throw half backward into the air as if to counterbalance any
tendency to trip ahab be see steadily manage -PRON- steering oar as in
a thousand boat lowering ere the white whale have tear -PRON- all at once
the outstretched arm give a peculiar motion and then remain fix
while the boat 's five oar be see simultaneously peak boat and
crew sit motionless on the sea instantly the three spread boat in the
rear pause on -PRON- way the whale have irregularly settle bodily
down into the blue thus give no distantly discernible token of the
movement though from -PRON- close vicinity ahab have observe -PRON-

every man look out along -PRON- oar cry starbuck thou queequeg
stand up

nimbly spring up on the triangular raise box in the bow the savage
stand erect there and with intensely eager eye gaze off towards the
spot where the chase have last be descry likewise upon the extreme
stern of the boat where -PRON- be also triangularly platformed level with
the gunwale starbuck -PRON- be see coolly and adroitly balance
-PRON- to the jerk tossing of -PRON- chip of a craft and silently
eye the vast blue eye of the sea

not very far distant flask 's boat be also lie breathlessly still -PRON-
commander recklessly stand upon the top of the loggerhead a stout
sort of post root in the keel and rise some two foot above the
level of the stern platform -PRON- be use for catch turn with the
whale line -PRON- top be not more spacious than the palm of a man 's hand
and stand upon such a base as that flask seem perch at the
mast head of some ship which have sink to all but -PRON- truck but little
king post be small and short and at the same time little king post be
full of a large and tall ambition so that this loggerhead stand point
of -PRON- did by no mean satisfy king post

-PRON- can not see three sea off tip -PRON- up an oar there and let -PRON- on to
that

upon this daggoo with either hand upon the gunwale to steady -PRON-
way swiftly slide aft and then erect -PRON- volunteer -PRON- lofty
shoulder for a pedestal

good a mast head as any sir will -PRON- mount

that -PRON- will and thank ye very much -PRON- fine fellow only -PRON- wish -PRON-
fifty foot tall

whereupon plant -PRON- foot firmly against two opposite plank of the
boat the gigantic negro stoop a little present -PRON- flat palm to
flask 's foot and then put flask 's hand on -PRON- hearse plumed head
and bid -PRON- spring as -PRON- -PRON- should toss with one dexterous
fling land the little man high and dry on -PRON- shoulder and here be
flask now stand daggoo with one lift arm furnish -PRON- with a
breastband to lean against and steady -PRON- by

at any time -PRON- be a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous
habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect
posture in -PRON- boat even when pitch about by the most riotously
perverse and cross run sea still more strange to see -PRON- giddily
perch upon the loggerhead -PRON- under such circumstance but the
sight of little flask mount upon gigantic daggoo be yet more curious
for sustain -PRON- with a cool indifferent easy unthought of
barbaric majesty the noble negro to every roll of the sea harmoniously
roll -PRON- fine form on -PRON- broad back flaxen haired flask seem
a snow flake the bearer look noble than the rider though truly
vivacious tumultuous ostentatious little flask would now and then
stamp with impatience but not one add heave do -PRON- thereby give to
the negro 's lordly chest so have -PRON- see passion and vanity stamp the
live magnanimous earth but the earth do not alter -PRON- tide and -PRON-
season for that

meanwhile stubb the third mate betray no such far gaze
solicitude the whale may have make one of -PRON- regular sounding
not a temporary dive from mere fright and if that be the case
stubb as -PRON- will not in such case -PRON- seem be resolve to solace the
languish interval with -PRON- pipe -PRON- withdraw -PRON- from -PRON- hatband
where -PRON- always wear -PRON- aslant like a feather -PRON- load -PRON- and ram
home the loading with -PRON- thumb end but hardly have -PRON- ignite -PRON- match
across the rough sandpaper of -PRON- hand when tashtego -PRON- harpooneer
whose eye have be set to windward like two fix star suddenly
drop like light from -PRON- erect attitude to -PRON- seat cry out in a
quick phrensy of hurry down down all and give way!--there -PRON- be

to a landsman no whale nor any sign of a herring would have be
visible at that moment nothing but a troubled bit of greenish white
water and thin scattered puff of vapour hover over -PRON- and
suffusingly blow off to leeward like the confused scud from white
roll billow the air around suddenly vibrate and tingle as -PRON-
be like the air over intensely heated plate of iron beneath this
atmospheric waving and curling and partially beneath a thin layer of
water also the whale be swimming see in advance of all the other
indication the puff of vapour -PRON- spout seem -PRON- forerunning
courier and detached fly outrider

all four boat be now in keen pursuit of that one spot of trouble
water and air but -PRON- bid fair to outstrip -PRON- -PRON- fly on and on
as a mass of interblend bubble bear down a rapid stream from the
hill

pull pull -PRON- good boy say starbuck in the lowest possible but
intensest concentrate whisper to -PRON- man while the sharp fix glance
from -PRON- eye dart straight ahead of the bow almost seem as two
visible needle in two unerring binnacle compass -PRON- do not say much
to -PRON- crew though nor do -PRON- crew say anything to -PRON- only the
silence of the boat be at interval startlingly pierce by one of -PRON-
peculiar whisper now harsh with command now soft with entreaty

how different the loud little king post sing out and say something
-PRON- heartie roar and pull -PRON- thunderbolt beach -PRON- beach -PRON- on -PRON-
black back boy only do that for -PRON- and -PRON- will sign over to -PRON- -PRON-
martha 's vineyard plantation boy include wife and child boy
lay -PRON- on lie -PRON- on o lord lord but -PRON- shall go stark star mad
see see that white water and so shouting -PRON- pull -PRON- hat from -PRON-
head and stamp up and down on -PRON- then pick -PRON- up flirt -PRON- far
off upon the sea and finally fall to rearing and plunge in the boat 's
stern like a crazed colt from the prairie

look at that chap now philosophically drawl stubb who with -PRON-
unlight short pipe mechanically retain between -PRON- tooth at a
short distance follow after--"he 's get fit that flask have fit
yes give -PRON- fit that be the very word pitch fit into 'em merrily
merrily heart alive pudding for supper -PRON- know merry be the word
pull babe pull suckling pull all but what the devil be -PRON-
hurry about softly softly and steadily -PRON- man only pull and
keep pull nothing more crack all -PRON- backbone and bite -PRON-
knife in two that be all take -PRON- easy why do not ye take -PRON- easy -PRON-
say and burst all -PRON- liver and lung

but what -PRON- be that inscrutable ahab say to that tiger yellow crew of
-PRON- these be word best omit here for -PRON- live under the blessed
light of the evangelical land only the infidel shark in the audacious
sea may give ear to such word when with tornado brow and eye of
red murder and foam glue lip ahab leap after -PRON- prey

meanwhile all the boat tear on the repeat specific allusion of
flask to that whale as -PRON- call the fictitious monster which
-PRON- declare to be incessantly tantalize -PRON- boat 's bow with -PRON-
tail these allusion of -PRON- be at time so vivid and life like that
-PRON- would cause some one or two of -PRON- man to snatch a fearful look
over the shoulder but this be against all rule for the oarsman
must put out -PRON- eye and ram a skewer through -PRON- neck usage
pronounce that -PRON- must have no organ but ear and no limb but
arm in these critical moment

-PRON- be a sight full of quick wonder and awe the vast swell of the
omnipotent sea the surge hollow roar -PRON- make as -PRON- roll along
the eight gunwale like gigantic bowl in a boundless bowling green
the brief suspend agony of the boat as -PRON- would tip for an instant on
the knife like edge of the sharp wave that almost seem threaten
to cut -PRON- in two the sudden profound dip into the watery glen and
hollow the keen spurring and goading to gain the top of the opposite
hill the headlong sl like slide down -PRON- other side all these
with the cry of the headsman and harpooneer and the shuddering gasp
of the oarsman with the wondrous sight of the ivory pequod bear
down upon -PRON- boat with outstretched sail like a wild hen after -PRON-
scream brood all this be thrilling

not the raw recruit march from the bosom of -PRON- wife into the fever
heat of -PRON- first battle not the dead man 's ghost encounter the
first unknown phantom in the other world neither of these can feel
stranger and strong emotion than that man do who for the first
time find -PRON- pull into the charm churn circle of the
hunt sperm whale

the dance white water make by the chase be now become more and more
visible owe to the increase darkness of the dun cloud shadow
flung upon the sea the jet of vapour no longer blend but tilt
everywhere to right and left the whale seem separate -PRON- wake
the boat be pull more apart starbuck give chase to three whale
run dead to leeward -PRON- sail be now set and with the still
rise wind -PRON- rush along the boat go with such madness through
the water that the lee oar could scarcely be work rapidly enough to
escape be tear from the row lock

soon -PRON- be run through a suffusing wide veil of mist neither ship
nor boat to be see

give way man whisper starbuck draw still further aft the sheet
of -PRON- sail there be time to kill a fish yet before the squall come
there be white water again!--close to spring

soon after two cry in quick succession on each side of -PRON- denote
that the other boat have get fast but hardly be -PRON- overheard when
with a lightning like hurtle whisper starbuck say stand up and
queequeg harpoon in hand spring to -PRON- foot

though not one of the oarsman be then face the life and death peril
so close to -PRON- ahead yet with -PRON- eye on the intense countenance
of the mate in the stern of the boat -PRON- know that the imminent
instant have come -PRON- hear too an enormous wallowing sound as of
fifty elephant stir in -PRON- litter meanwhile the boat be still
boom through the mist the wave curling and hiss around -PRON- like
the erect crest of enrage serpent

that be -PRON- hump there there give -PRON- to -PRON- whisper starbuck

a short rush sound leap out of the boat -PRON- be the dart iron of
queequeg then all in one welded commotion come an invisible push from
astern while forward the boat seem strike on a ledge the sail
collapse and explode a gush of scald vapour shot up near by
something roll and tumble like an earthquake beneath -PRON- the whole
crew be half suffocate as -PRON- be toss helter skelter into the
white curdling cream of the squall squall whale and harpoon have all
blend together and the whale merely graze by the iron escape

though completely swamp the boat be nearly unharmed swim round
-PRON- -PRON- pick up the float oar and lash -PRON- across the gunwale
tumble back to -PRON- place there -PRON- sit up to -PRON- knee in the sea the
water cover every rib and plank so that to -PRON- downward gazing eye
the suspend craft seem a coral boat grow up to -PRON- from the bottom
of the ocean

the wind increase to a howl the wave dash -PRON- buckler together
the whole squall roar fork and crackle around -PRON- like a white
fire upon the prairie in which unconsumed -PRON- be burn immortal
in these jaw of death in vain -PRON- hail the other boat as well roar
to the live coal down the chimney of a flaming furnace as hail those
boat in that storm meanwhile the drive scud rack and mist grow
dark with the shadow of night no sign of the ship could be see
the rise sea forbid all attempt to bale out the boat the oar be
useless as propeller perform now the office of life preserver
so cut the lashing of the waterproof match keg after many failure
starbuck contrive to ignite the lamp in the lantern then stretch
-PRON- on a waif pole hand -PRON- to queequeg as the standard bearer of this
forlorn hope there then -PRON- sit hold up that imbecile candle in
the heart of that almighty forlornness there then -PRON- sit the sign
and symbol of a man without faith hopelessly hold up hope in the
midst of despair

wet drench through and shiver cold despair of ship or boat
-PRON- lift up -PRON- eye as the dawn come on the mist still spread over
the sea the empty lantern lie crush in the bottom of the boat
suddenly queequeg start to -PRON- foot hollow -PRON- hand to -PRON- ear
-PRON- all hear a faint creaking as of rope and yard hitherto muffle by
the storm the sound come nearer and nearer the thick mist be dimly
part by a huge vague form affrighted -PRON- all spring into the sea as
the ship at last loom into view bear right down upon -PRON- within a
distance of not much more than -PRON- length

float on the wave -PRON- see the abandoned boat as for one instant -PRON-
toss and gap beneath the ship 's bow like a chip at the base of a
cataract and then the vast hull roll over -PRON- and -PRON- be see no
more till -PRON- come up welter astern again -PRON- swim for -PRON- be dash
against -PRON- by the sea and be at last take up and safely land on
board ere the squall come close to the other boat have cut loose from
-PRON- fish and return to the ship in good time the ship have give -PRON-
up but be still cruise if haply -PRON- may light upon some token of
-PRON- perishing an oar or a lance pole



chapter 49 the hyena


there be certain queer time and occasion in this strange mixed affair
-PRON- call life when a man take this whole universe for a vast practical
joke though the wit thereof -PRON- but dimly discern and more than
suspect that the joke be at nobody 's expense but -PRON- own however
nothing dispirit and nothing seem worth while dispute -PRON- bolt
down all event all creed and belief and persuasion all hard
thing visible and invisible never mind how knobby as an ostrich of
potent digestion gobble down bullet and gun flint and as for small
difficulty and worrying prospect of sudden disaster peril of
life and limb all these and death -PRON- seem to -PRON- only sly
good natured hit and jolly punch in the side bestow by the unseen
and unaccountable old joker that odd sort of wayward mood -PRON- be speak
of come over a man only in some time of extreme tribulation -PRON- come
in the very midst of -PRON- earnestness so that what just before may
have seem to -PRON- a thing most momentous now seem but a part of the
general joke there be nothing like the peril of whaling to breed this
free and easy sort of genial desperado philosophy and with -PRON- -PRON- now
regard this whole voyage of the pequod and the great white whale -PRON-
object

queequeg say -PRON- when -PRON- have drag -PRON- the last man to the deck
and -PRON- be still shake -PRON- in -PRON- jacket to fl off the water
queequeg -PRON- fine friend do this sort of thing often happen
without much emotion though soak through just like -PRON- -PRON- give -PRON- to
understand that such thing do often happen

mr. stubb say -PRON- turn to that worthy who button up in -PRON-
oil jacket be now calmly smoke -PRON- pipe in the rain mr. stubb -PRON-
think -PRON- have hear -PRON- say that of all whalemen -PRON- ever meet -PRON- chief
mate mr. starbuck be by far the most careful and prudent -PRON- suppose
then that go plump on a fly whale with -PRON- sail set in a foggy
squall be the height of a whaleman 's discretion

certain -PRON- have lower for whale from a leak ship in a gale off cape
horn

mr. flask say -PRON- turn to little king post who be stand close
by -PRON- be experience in these thing and -PRON- be not will -PRON- tell
-PRON- whether -PRON- be an unalterable law in this fishery mr. flask for an
oarsman to break -PRON- own back pull -PRON- back foremost into death 's
jaw

ca n't -PRON- twist that small say flask yes that be the law
-PRON- should like to see a boat 's crew backing water up to a whale face
foremost ha ha the whale would give -PRON- squint for squint mind
that

here then from three impartial witness -PRON- have a deliberate statement
of the entire case consider therefore that squall and capsizing
in the water and consequent bivouack on the deep be matter
of common occurrence in this kind of life consider that at the
superlatively critical instant of go on to the whale -PRON- must resign -PRON-
life into the hand of -PRON- who steer the boat oftentim a fellow who
at that very moment be in -PRON- impetuousness upon the point of scuttle
the craft with -PRON- own frantic stamping consider that the
particular disaster to -PRON- own particular boat be chiefly to be imputed
to starbuck 's drive on to -PRON- whale almost in the tooth of a squall
and consider that starbuck notwithstanding be famous for -PRON-
great heedfulness in the fishery consider that -PRON- belong to this
uncommonly prudent starbuck 's boat and finally consider in what a
devil 's chase -PRON- be implicate touch the white whale take all
thing together -PRON- say -PRON- think -PRON- may as well go below and make a
rough draft of -PRON- will queequeg say -PRON- come along -PRON- shall be -PRON-
lawyer executor and legatee

-PRON- may seem strange that of all man sailor should be tinker at -PRON-
last will and testament but there be no people in the world more
fond of that diversion this be the fourth time in -PRON- nautical life
that -PRON- have do the same thing after the ceremony be conclude upon
the present occasion -PRON- feel all the easy a stone be roll away
from -PRON- heart besides all the day -PRON- should now live would be as good
as the day that lazarus live after -PRON- resurrection a supplementary
clean gain of so many month or week as the case may be -PRON- survive
-PRON- -PRON- death and burial be lock up in -PRON- chest -PRON- look
round -PRON- tranquilly and contentedly like a quiet ghost with a clean
conscience sit inside the bar of a snug family vault

now then think -PRON- unconsciously roll up the sleeve of -PRON- frock
here go for a cool collect dive at death and destruction and the
devil fetch the hindmost



chapter 50 ahab 's boat and crew fedallah


who would have think -PRON- flask cry stubb if -PRON- have but one leg
-PRON- would not catch -PRON- in a boat unless maybe to stop the plug hole
with -PRON- timber toe oh -PRON- be a wonderful old man

-PRON- do not think -PRON- so strange after all on that account say flask
if -PRON- leg be off at the hip now -PRON- would be a different thing
that would disable -PRON- but -PRON- have one knee and good part of the other
leave -PRON- know

-PRON- do not know that -PRON- little man -PRON- never yet see -PRON- kneel


among whale wise people -PRON- have often be argue whether consider
the paramount importance of -PRON- life to the success of the voyage -PRON- be
right for a whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the active peril
of the chase so tamerlane 's soldier often argue with tear in -PRON-
eye whether that invaluable life of -PRON- ought to be carry into the
thick of the fight

but with ahab the question assume a modified aspect consider
that with two leg man be but a hobbling wight in all time of danger
consider that the pursuit of whale be always under great and
extraordinary difficulty that every individual moment indeed then
comprise a peril under these circumstance be -PRON- wise for any
maim man to enter a whale boat in the hunt as a general thing the
joint owner of the pequod must have plainly think not

ahab well know that although -PRON- friend at home would think little of
-PRON- enter a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitude of
the chase for the sake of be near the scene of action and give
-PRON- order in person yet for captain ahab to have a boat actually
apportion to -PRON- as a regular headsman in the hunt above all for
captain ahab to be supply with five extra man as that same boat 's
crew -PRON- well know that such generous conceit never enter the head
of the owner of the pequod therefore -PRON- have not solicit a boat 's
crew from -PRON- nor have -PRON- in any way hint -PRON- desire on that head
nevertheless -PRON- have take private measure of -PRON- own touch all
that matter until cabaco 's publish discovery the sailor have little
foresee -PRON- though to be sure when after be a little while out
of port all hand have conclude the customary business of fit the
whaleboat for service when some time after this ahab be now and then
find bestir -PRON- in the matter of make thole pin with -PRON-
own hand for what be think to be one of the spare boat and even
solicitously cut the small wooden skewer which when the line be
run out be pin over the groove in the bow when all this be
observe in -PRON- and particularly -PRON- solicitude in have an extra
coat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat as if to make -PRON- good
withstand the pointed pressure of -PRON- ivory limb and also the anxiety
-PRON- evince in exactly shape the thigh board or clumsy cleat as -PRON- be
sometimes call the horizontal piece in the boat 's bow for brace the
knee against in dart or stab at the whale when -PRON- be observe
how often -PRON- stand up in that boat with -PRON- solitary knee fix in the
semi circular depression in the cleat and with the carpenter 's chisel
gouge out a little here and straighten -PRON- a little there all these
thing -PRON- say have awaken much interest and curiosity at the time but
almost everybody suppose that this particular preparative heedfulness
in ahab must only be with a view to the ultimate chase of moby dick
for -PRON- have already reveal -PRON- intention to hunt that mortal monster
in person but such a supposition do by no mean involve the remotest
suspicion as to any boat 's crew be assign to that boat

now with the subordinate phantom what wonder remain soon wan
away for in a whaler wonder soon wane besides now and then such
unaccountable odd and end of strange nation come up from the unknown
nook and ash hole of the earth to man these float outlaw of
whaler and the ship -PRON- often pick up such queer castaway
creature find toss about the open sea on plank bit of wreck
oar whaleboat canoe blow off japanese junk and what not that
beelzebub -PRON- may climb up the side and step down into the cabin
to chat with the captain and -PRON- would not create any unsubduable
excitement in the forecastle

but be all this as -PRON- may certain -PRON- be that while the subordinate
phantom soon find -PRON- place among the crew though still as -PRON- be
somehow distinct from -PRON- yet that hair turban fedallah remain
a muffled mystery to the last whence -PRON- come in a mannerly world like
this by what sort of unaccountable tie -PRON- soon evince -PRON- to be
link with ahab 's peculiar fortune nay so far as to have some sort
of a half hinted influence heaven know but -PRON- may have be even
authority over -PRON- all this none know but one can not sustain
an indifferent air concern fedallah -PRON- be such a creature as
civilized domestic people in the temperate zone only see in -PRON-
dream and that but dimly but the like of whom now and then glide
among the unchang asiatic community especially the oriental isle
to the east of the continent those insulate immemorial unalterable
country which even in these modern day still preserve much of the
ghostly aboriginalness of earth 's primal generation when the memory of
the first man be a distinct recollection and all man -PRON- descendant
unknowing whence -PRON- come eye each other as real phantom and ask of
the sun and the moon why -PRON- be create and to what end when though
accord to genesis the angel indeed consort with the daughter of
man the devil also add the uncanonical rabbins indulge in mundane
amour



chapter 51 the spirit spout


day week pass and under easy sail the ivory pequod have slowly
sweep across four several cruise ground that off the azores off the
cape de verdes on the plate so call be off the mouth of the
rio de la plata and the carrol ground an unstaked watery locality
southerly from st. helena

-PRON- be while glide through these latter water that one serene and
moonlight night when all the wave roll by like scroll of silver
and by -PRON- soft suffuse seething make what seem a silvery
silence not a solitude on such a silent night a silvery jet be see
far in advance of the white bubble at the bow lit up by the moon -PRON-
look celestial seem some plumed and glitter god uprising from
the sea fedallah first descry this jet for of these moonlight
night -PRON- be -PRON- will not to mount to the main mast head and stand a
look out there with the same precision as if -PRON- have be day and yet
though herd of whale be see by night not one whaleman in a hundred
would venture a lower for -PRON- -PRON- may think with what emotion
then the seamen behold this old oriental perch aloft at such unusual
hour -PRON- turban and the moon companion in one sky but when after
spend -PRON- uniform interval there for several successive night
without utter a single sound when after all this silence -PRON-
unearthly voice be hear announce that silvery moon light jet every
recline mariner start to -PRON- foot as if some winged spirit have
light in the rigging and hail the mortal crew there -PRON- blow
have the trump of judgment blow -PRON- could not have quiver more yet
still -PRON- feel no terror rather pleasure for though -PRON- be a most
unwonted hour yet so impressive be the cry and so deliriously
exciting that almost every soul on board instinctively desire a
lower

walk the deck with quick side lunge stride ahab command the
t'gallant sail and royal to be set and every stunsail spread the
good man in the ship must take the helm then with every mast head
man the pile up craft roll down before the wind the strange
upheaving lift tendency of the taffrail breeze fill the hollow
of so many sail make the buoyant hover deck to feel like air
beneath the foot while still -PRON- rush along as if two antagonistic
influence be struggle in -PRON- one to mount direct to heaven the
other to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal and have -PRON- watch
ahab 's face that night -PRON- would have think that in -PRON- also two
different thing be war while -PRON- one live leg make lively echo
along the deck every stroke of -PRON- dead limb sound like a coffin tap
on life and death this old man walk but though the ship so swiftly
speed and though from every eye like arrow the eager glance shoot
yet the silvery jet be no more see that night every sailor swear -PRON-
see -PRON- once but not a second time

this midnight spout have almost grow a forgotten thing when some day
after lo at the same silent hour -PRON- be again announce again -PRON-
be descry by all but upon make sail to overtake -PRON- once more -PRON-
disappear as if -PRON- have never be and so -PRON- serve -PRON- night after
night till no one heed -PRON- but to wonder at -PRON- mysteriously
jet into the clear moonlight or starlight as the case may be
disappear again for one whole day or two day or three and somehow
seem at every distinct repetition to be advance still further and
further in -PRON- van this solitary jet seem for ever allure -PRON- on

nor with the immemorial superstition of -PRON- race and in accordance
with the preternaturalness as -PRON- seem which in many thing invest
the pequod be there want some of the seaman who swear that
whenever and wherever descried at however remote time or in however
far apart latitude and longitude that unnearable spout be cast
by one self same whale and that whale moby dick for a time there
reign too a sense of peculiar dread at this flit apparition
as if -PRON- be treacherously beckon -PRON- on and on in order that the
monster may turn round upon -PRON- and rend -PRON- at last in the remotest
and most savage sea

these temporary apprehension so vague but so awful derive a wondrous
potency from the contrast serenity of the weather in which beneath
all -PRON- blue blandness some think there lurk a devilish charm as
for day and day -PRON- voyage along through sea so wearily lonesomely
mild that all space in repugnance to -PRON- vengeful errand seem
vacate -PRON- of life before -PRON- urn like prow

but at last when turn to the eastward the cape wind begin howl
around -PRON- and -PRON- rise and fall upon the long troubled sea that be
there when the ivory tusk pequod sharply bow to the blast and
gore the dark wave in -PRON- madness till like shower of silver chip
the foam flake fly over -PRON- bulwark then all this desolate vacuity
of life go away but give place to sights more dismal than before

close to -PRON- bow strange form in the water dart hither and thither
before -PRON- while thick in -PRON- rear fly the inscrutable sea raven and
every morning perch on -PRON- stay row of these bird be see and
spite of -PRON- hooting for a long time obstinately cling to the hemp
as though -PRON- deem -PRON- ship some drifting uninhabited craft a thing
appoint to desolation and therefore fit roost place for -PRON-
homeless self and heave and heave still unrestingly heave the
black sea as if -PRON- vast tide be a conscience and the great mundane
soul be in anguish and remorse for the long sin and suffering -PRON- have
breed

cape of good hope do -PRON- call ye rather cape tormentoto as call
of yore for long allure by the perfidious silence that before have
attend -PRON- -PRON- find -PRON- launch into this tormented sea
where guilty being transform into those fowl and these fish seem
condemn to swim on everlastingly without any haven in store or beat
that black air without any horizon but calm snow white and unvarying
still direct -PRON- fountain of feather to the sky still beckon -PRON-
on from before the solitary jet would at time be descry

during all this blackness of the element ahab though assume for the
time the almost continual command of the drench and dangerous deck
manifest the gloomy reserve and more seldom than ever address
-PRON- mate in tempestuous time like these after everything above and
aloft have be secure nothing more can be do but passively to await
the issue of the gale then captain and crew become practical fatalist
so with -PRON- ivory leg insert into -PRON- accustomed hole and with one
hand firmly grasp a shroud ahab for hour and hour would stand
gaze dead to windward while an occasional squall of sleet or snow
would all but congeal -PRON- very eyelash together meantime the crew
drive from the forward part of the ship by the perilous sea that
burstingly break over -PRON- bow stand in a line along the bulwark in
the waist and the good to guard against the leap wave each man
have slip -PRON- into a sort of bowline secure to the rail in which
-PRON- swing as in a loosen belt few or no word be speak and the
silent ship as if man by paint sailor in wax day after day tear
on through all the swift madness and gladness of the demoniac wave
by night the same muteness of humanity before the shriek of the
ocean prevail still in silence the man swing in the bowline still
wordless ahab stand up to the blast even when wearied nature seem
demand repose -PRON- would not seek that repose in -PRON- hammock never
could starbuck forget the old man 's aspect when one night go down
into the cabin to mark how the barometer stand -PRON- see -PRON- with
close eye sit straight in -PRON- floor screw chair the rain
and half melt sleet of the storm from which -PRON- have some time before
emerge still slowly drip from the unremoved hat and coat on the
table beside -PRON- lie unrolled one of those chart of tide and current
which have previously be speak of -PRON- lantern swing from -PRON- tightly
clenched hand though the body be erect the head be throw back so
that the close eye be point towards the needle of the tell tale
that swing from a beam in the ceiling


the cabin compass be call the tell tale because without go to the
compass at the helm the captain while below can inform -PRON- of the
course of the ship


terrible old man think starbuck with a shudder sleep in this
gale still thou steadfastly ey thy purpose



chapter 52 the albatross


south eastward from the cape off the distant crozetts a good cruising
ground for right whalemen a sail loom ahead the goney albatross
by name as -PRON- slowly draw nigh from -PRON- lofty perch at the
fore mast head -PRON- have a good view of that sight so remarkable to a tyro
in the far ocean fishery a whaler at sea and long absent from home

as if the wave have be fuller this craft be bleach like the
skeleton of a strand walrus all down -PRON- side this spectral
appearance be trace with long channel of reddened rust while all -PRON-
spar and -PRON- rig be like the thick branch of tree fur over
with hoar frost only -PRON- low sail be set a wild sight -PRON- be to
see -PRON- long bearded look out at those three mast head -PRON- seem
clothe in the skin of beast so torn and bepatch the raiment that have
survive nearly four year of cruising stand in iron hoop nail to
the mast -PRON- sway and swing over a fathomless sea and though when
the ship slowly glide close under -PRON- stern -PRON- six man in the air
come so nigh to each other that -PRON- may almost have leap from the
mast head of one ship to those of the other yet those forlorn look
fisherman mildly eye -PRON- as -PRON- pass say not one word to -PRON- own
look out while the quarter deck hail be be hear from below

ship ahoy have ye see the white whale

but as the strange captain lean over the pallid bulwark be in the
act of put -PRON- trumpet to -PRON- mouth -PRON- somehow fall from -PRON- hand
into the sea and the wind now rise amain -PRON- in vain strove to make
-PRON- hear without -PRON- meantime -PRON- ship be still increase the
distance between while in various silent way the seamen of the pequod
be evince -PRON- observance of this ominous incident at the first
mere mention of the white whale 's name to another ship ahab for a
moment pause -PRON- almost seem as though -PRON- would have lower a boat
to board the stranger have not the threaten wind forbade but take
advantage of -PRON- windward position -PRON- again seize -PRON- trumpet and
know by -PRON- aspect that the stranger vessel be a nantucketer and
shortly bind home -PRON- loudly hailed--"ahoy there this be the pequod
bind round the world tell -PRON- to address all future letter to the
pacific ocean and this time three year if -PRON- be not at home tell -PRON-
to address -PRON- to--

at that moment the two wake be fairly cross and instantly then
in accordance with -PRON- singular way shoal of small harmless fish
that for some day before have be placidly swimming by -PRON- side dart
away with what seem shudder fin and range -PRON- fore and
aft with the stranger 's flank though in the course of -PRON- continual
voyaging ahab must often before have notice a similar sight yet to
any monomaniac man the veri trifle capriciously carry meaning

swim away from -PRON- do ye murmur ahab gaze over into the water
there seem but little in the word but the tone convey more of deep
helpless sadness than the insane old man have ever before evince but
turn to the steersman who thus far have be hold the ship in the
wind to diminish -PRON- headway -PRON- cry out in -PRON- old lion voice,--"up
helm keep -PRON- off round the world

round the world there be much in that sound to inspire proud feeling
but whereto do all that circumnavigation conduct only through
numberless peril to the very point whence -PRON- start where those that
-PRON- leave behind secure be all the time before -PRON-

be this world an endless plain and by sail eastward -PRON- could for
ever reach new distance and discover sight more sweet and strange
than any cyclade or islands of king solomon then there be promise
in the voyage but in pursuit of those far mystery -PRON- dream of or in
torment chase of that demon phantom that some time or other swim
before all human heart while chase such over this round globe -PRON-
either lead -PRON- on in barren maze or midway leave -PRON- whelm



chapter 53 the gam


the ostensible reason why ahab do not go on board of the whaler -PRON- have
speak be this the wind and sea betoken storm but even have
this not be the case -PRON- would not after all perhaps have board
-PRON- judge by -PRON- subsequent conduct on similar occasion if so -PRON-
have be that by the process of hail -PRON- have obtain a negative
answer to the question -PRON- put for as -PRON- eventually turn out -PRON-
care not to consort even for five minute with any stranger captain
except -PRON- could contribute some of that information -PRON- so absorbingly
seek but all this may remain inadequately estimate be not
something say here of the peculiar usage of whaling vessel when
meet each other in foreign sea and especially on a common
cruise ground

if two stranger cross the pine barrens in new york state or the
equally desolate salisbury plain in england if casually encounter
each other in such inhospitable wild these twain for the life of
-PRON- can not well avoid a mutual salutation and stop for a moment
to interchange the news and perhaps sit down for a while
and rest in concert then how much more natural that upon the
illimitable pine barrens and salisbury plains of the sea two whale
vessel descry each other at the end of the earth off lone
fanning 's island or the far away king 's mills how much more natural
-PRON- say that under such circumstance these ship should not only
interchange hail but come into still close more friendly and
sociable contact and especially would this seem to be a matter of
course in the case of vessel own in one seaport and whose captain
officer and not a few of the man be personally know to each other
and consequently have all sort of dear domestic thing to talk about

for the long absent ship the outward bounder perhaps have letter on
board at any rate -PRON- will be sure to let -PRON- have some paper of a
date a year or two later than the last one on -PRON- blurred and thumb wear
file and in return for that courtesy the outward bind ship would
receive the late whaling intelligence from the cruising ground to
which -PRON- may be destine a thing of the utmost importance to -PRON- and
in degree all this will hold true concern whaling vessel cross
each other 's track on the cruising ground -PRON- even though -PRON-
be equally long absent from home for one of -PRON- may have receive a
transfer of letter from some third and now far remote vessel and
some of those letter may be for the people of the ship -PRON- now meet
besides -PRON- would exchange the whaling news and have an agreeable
chat for not only would -PRON- meet with all the sympathy of sailor
but likewise with all the peculiar congeniality arise from a common
pursuit and mutually shared privation and peril

nor would difference of country make any very essential difference
that be so long as both party speak one language as be the case
with americans and english though to be sure from the small number of
english whaler such meeting do not very often occur and when -PRON-
do occur there be too apt to be a sort of shyness between -PRON- for -PRON-
englishman be rather reserved and -PRON- yankee -PRON- do not fancy that
sort of thing in anybody but -PRON- besides the english whaler
sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over the american
whaler regard the long lean nantucketer with -PRON- nondescript
provincialism as a sort of sea peasant but where this superiority
in the english whalemen do really consist -PRON- would be hard to say
see that the yankees in one day collectively kill more whale than
all the english collectively in ten year but this be a harmless
little foible in the english whale hunter which the nantucketer do
not take much to heart probably because -PRON- know that -PRON- have a few
foibl -PRON-

so then -PRON- see that of all ship separately sail the sea the
whaler have most reason to be sociable and -PRON- be so whereas some
merchant ship cross each other 's wake in the mid atlantic will
oftentime pass on without so much as a single word of recognition
mutually cut each other on the high sea like a brace of dandy in
broadway and all the time indulge perhaps in finical criticism upon
each other 's rig as for men of war when -PRON- chance to meet at sea
-PRON- first go through such a string of silly bowing and scraping such
a ducking of ensign that there do not seem to be much right down
hearty good will and brotherly love about -PRON- at all as touch
slave ship meeting why -PRON- be in such a prodigious hurry -PRON- run
away from each other as soon as possible and as for pirates when -PRON-
chance to cross each other 's cross bone the first hail is--"how many
skull the same way that whaler hail--"how many barrel and that
question once answer pirate straightway steer apart for -PRON- be
infernal villain on both side and do not like to see overmuch of each
other 's villanous likeness

but look at the godly honest unostentatious hospitable sociable
free and easy whaler what do the whaler do when -PRON- meet another
whaler in any sort of decent weather -PRON- have a gam a thing so
utterly unknown to all other ship that -PRON- never hear of the name
even and if by chance -PRON- should hear of -PRON- -PRON- only grin at -PRON- and
repeat gamesome stuff about spouter and blubber boiler and such
like pretty exclamation why -PRON- be that all merchant seamen and also
all pirates and man of war 's man and slave ship sailor cherish such
a scornful feeling towards whale ship this be a question -PRON- would be
hard to answer because in the case of pirate say -PRON- should like to
know whether that profession of -PRON- have any peculiar glory about
-PRON- -PRON- sometimes end in uncommon elevation indeed but only at the
gallow and besides when a man be elevate in that odd fashion -PRON- have
no proper foundation for -PRON- superior altitude hence -PRON- conclude
that in boast -PRON- to be high lift above a whaleman in that
assertion the pirate have no solid basis to stand on

but what be a gam -PRON- may wear out -PRON- index finger run up and
down the column of dictionary and never find the word dr. johnson
never attain to that erudition noah webster 's ark do not hold -PRON-
nevertheless this same expressive word have now for many year be in
constant use among some fifteen thousand true bear yankees certainly
-PRON- need a definition and should be incorporate into the lexicon with
that view let -PRON- learnedly define -PRON-

gam noun a social meeting of two or more whaleships generally on a
cruising ground when after exchanging hail they exchange visit by
boats crews the two captain remaining for the time on board of one
ship and the two chief mat on the other

there be another little item about gam which must not be forget
here all profession have -PRON- own little peculiarity of detail so
have the whale fishery in a pirate man of war or slave ship when
the captain be row anywhere in -PRON- boat -PRON- always sit in the stern
sheet on a comfortable sometimes cushion seat there and often
steer -PRON- with a pretty little milliner 's tiller decorate with
gay cord and ribbon but the whale boat have no seat astern no sofa of
that sort whatever and no tiller at all high time indeed if whaling
captain be wheel about the water on castor like gouty old alderman
in patent chair and as for a tiller the whale boat never admit of
any such effeminacy and therefore as in gam a complete boat 's crew
must leave the ship and hence as the boat steerer or harpooneer be of
the number that subordinate be the steersman upon the occasion and
the captain have no place to sit in be pull off to -PRON- visit
all stand like a pine tree and often -PRON- will notice that be
conscious of the eye of the whole visible world rest on -PRON- from
the side of the two ship this stand captain be all alive to the
importance of sustain -PRON- dignity by maintain -PRON- leg nor be
this any very easy matter for in -PRON- rear be the immense project
steer oar hit -PRON- now and then in the small of -PRON- back the
after oar reciprocating by rap -PRON- knee in front -PRON- be thus
completely wedge before and behind and can only expand -PRON-
sideways by settle down on -PRON- stretch leg but a sudden violent
pitch of the boat will often go far to topple -PRON- because length of
foundation be nothing without correspond breadth merely make a
spread angle of two pole and -PRON- can not stand -PRON- up then again
-PRON- would never do in plain sight of the world 's rivet eye -PRON- would
never do -PRON- say for this straddle captain to be see steady
-PRON- the slight particle by catch hold of anything with
-PRON- hand indeed as token of -PRON- entire buoyant self command -PRON-
generally carry -PRON- hand in -PRON- trowser pocket but perhaps be
generally very large heavy hand -PRON- carry -PRON- there for ballast
nevertheless there have occur instance well authenticated one too
where the captain have be know for an uncommonly critical moment or
two in a sudden squall say to seize hold of the near oarsman 's
hair and hold on there like grim death



chapter 54 the town ho 's story


as told at the golden inn


the cape of good hope and all the watery region round about there be
much like some note four corner of a great highway where -PRON- meet
more traveller than in any other part

-PRON- be not very long after speak the goney that another
homeward bind whaleman the town ho be encounter -PRON- be man
almost wholly by polynesians in the short gam that ensued -PRON- give
-PRON- strong news of moby dick to some the general interest in the white
whale be now wildly heighten by a circumstance of the town ho 's
story which seem obscurely to involve with the whale a certain
wondrous inverted visitation of one of those so call judgment of god
which at time be say to overtake some man this latter circumstance
with -PRON- own particular accompaniment form what may be call the
secret part of the tragedy about to be narrate never reach the ear
of captain ahab or -PRON- mate for that secret part of the story be
unknown to the captain of the town ho -PRON- -PRON- be the private
property of three confederate white seaman of that ship one of whom -PRON-
seem communicate -PRON- to tashtego with romish injunction of secrecy
but the following night tashtego ramble in -PRON- sleep and reveal
so much of -PRON- in that way that when -PRON- be waken -PRON- could not well
withhold the rest nevertheless so potent an influence do this thing
have on those seaman in the pequod who come to the full knowledge of
-PRON- and by such a strange delicacy to call -PRON- so be -PRON- govern in
this matter that -PRON- keep the secret among -PRON- so that -PRON- never
transpire abaft the pequod 's main mast interweave in -PRON- proper
place this dark thread with the story as publicly narrate on the
ship the whole of this strange affair -PRON- now proce to put on last
record


the ancient whale cry upon first sighting a whale from the mast head
still use by whaleman in hunt the famous gallipagos terrapin


for -PRON- humor 's sake -PRON- shall preserve the style in which -PRON- once narrate
-PRON- at lima to a lounge circle of -PRON- spanish friend one saint 's eve
smoke upon the thick gilt tiled piazza of the golden inn of those
fine cavalier the young don pedro and sebastian be on the close
term with -PRON- and hence the interlude question -PRON- occasionally
put and which be duly answer at the time

some two year prior to -PRON- first learn the event which -PRON- be about
rehearse to -PRON- gentleman the town ho sperm whaler of nantucket
be cruise in -PRON- pacific here not very many day sail eastward
from the eaf of this good golden inn -PRON- be somewhere to the
northward of the line one morning upon handle the pump accord to
daily usage -PRON- be observe that -PRON- make more water in -PRON- hold than
common -PRON- suppose a sword fish have stab -PRON- gentleman but the
captain have some unusual reason for believe that rare good luck
await -PRON- in those latitude and therefore be very averse to quit
-PRON- and the leak not be then consider at all dangerous though
indeed -PRON- could not find -PRON- after search the hold as low down
as be possible in rather heavy weather the ship still continue -PRON-
cruising the mariner work at the pump at wide and easy interval
but no good luck come more day go by and not only be the leak yet
undiscovered but -PRON- sensibly increase so much so that now take
some alarm the captain make all sail stand away for the near
harbor among the island there to have -PRON- hull hove out and repair

though no small passage be before -PRON- yet if the common chance
favour -PRON- do not at all fear that -PRON- ship would founder by the way
because -PRON- pump be of the good and be periodically relieve at
-PRON- those six and thirty man of -PRON- could easily keep the ship free
never mind if the leak should double on -PRON- in truth well nigh the
whole of this passage be attend by very prosperous breezes the
town ho have all but certainly arrive in perfect safety at -PRON- port
without the occurrence of the least fatality have -PRON- not be for the
brutal overbearing of radney the mate a vineyarder and the bitterly
provoke vengeance of steelkilt a lakeman and desperado from buffalo

lakeman!--buffalo pray what be a lakeman and where be buffalo
say don sebastian rise in -PRON- swinging mat of grass

on the eastern shore of -PRON- lake erie don but -PRON- crave -PRON-
courtesy may be -PRON- shall soon hear further of all that now
gentleman in square sail brig and three masted ship well nigh as
large and stout as any that ever sail out of -PRON- old callao to far
manilla this lakeman in the land lock heart of -PRON- america have yet
be nurture by all those agrarian freebooting impression popularly
connect with the open ocean for in -PRON- interflow aggregate
those grand fresh water sea of -PRON- erie and ontario and huron and
superior and michigan posses an ocean like expansiveness with many
of the ocean 's noblest trait with many of -PRON- rimmed variety of
race and of clime -PRON- contain round archipelago of romantic isle
even as the polynesian water do in large part be shore by two great
contrast nation as the atlantic be -PRON- furnish long maritime
approach to -PRON- numerous territorial colony from the east dot
all round -PRON- bank here and there be frown upon by battery
and by the goat like craggy gun of lofty mackinaw -PRON- have hear the
fleet thundering of naval victory at interval -PRON- yield -PRON-
beach to wild barbarian whose red paint face flash from out
-PRON- peltry wigwam for league and league be flank by ancient
and unentered forest where the gaunt pine stand like serried line
of king in gothic genealogy those same wood harbor wild afric
beast of prey and silken creature whose export fur give robe
to tartar emperors -PRON- mirror the pave capital of buffalo and
cleveland as well as winnebago village -PRON- float alike the
full rigged merchant ship the armed cruiser of the state the steamer
and the beech canoe -PRON- be sweep by borean and dismast blast as
direful as any that lash the salt wave -PRON- know what shipwreck be
for out of sight of land however inland -PRON- have drown full many
a midnight ship with all -PRON- shrieking crew thus gentleman though
an inlander steelkilt be wild ocean bear and wild ocean nurture
as much of an audacious mariner as any and for radney though in -PRON-
infancy -PRON- may have lay -PRON- down on the lone nantucket beach to nurse
at -PRON- maternal sea though in after life -PRON- have long follow -PRON-
austere atlantic and -PRON- contemplative pacific yet be -PRON- quite as
vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods seaman fresh
from the latitude of buck horn handle bowie knife yet be this
nantucketer a man with some good hearted trait and this lakeman a
mariner who though a sort of devil indeed may yet by inflexible
firmness only temper by that common decency of human recognition
which be the mean slave 's right thus treat this steelkilt have
long be retain harmless and docile at all event -PRON- have prove
so thus far but radney be doom and make mad and steelkilt but
gentleman -PRON- shall hear

-PRON- be not more than a day or two at the furth after point
-PRON- prow for -PRON- island haven that the town ho 's leak seem again
increase but only so as to require an hour or more at the pump
every day -PRON- must know that in a settle and civilize ocean like -PRON-
atlantic for example some skipper think little of pump -PRON- whole
way across -PRON- though of a still sleepy night should the officer of
the deck happen to forget -PRON- duty in that respect the probability
would be that -PRON- and -PRON- shipmate would never again remember -PRON- on
account of all hand gently subside to the bottom nor in the
solitary and savage sea far from -PRON- to the westward gentleman be -PRON-
altogether unusual for ship to keep clang at -PRON- pump handle in
full chorus even for a voyage of considerable length that be if -PRON- lie
along a tolerably accessible coast or if any other reasonable retreat
be afford -PRON- -PRON- be only when a leaky vessel be in some very out of
the way part of those water some really landless latitude that -PRON-
captain begin to feel a little anxious

much this way have -PRON- be with the town ho so when -PRON- leak be find
gain once more there be in truth some small concern manifest by
several of -PRON- company especially by radney the mate -PRON- command
the upper sail to be well hoist sheet home anew and every way
expand to the breeze now this radney -PRON- suppose be as little of a
coward and as little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness
touch -PRON- own person as any fearless unthinking creature on land or
on sea that -PRON- can conveniently imagine gentleman therefore when
-PRON- betray this solicitude about the safety of the ship some of the
seaman declare that -PRON- be only on account of -PRON- be a part owner in
-PRON- so when -PRON- be work that evening at the pump there be on
this head no small gamesomeness slily go on among -PRON- as -PRON- stand
with -PRON- foot continually overflow by the ripple clear water
clear as any mountain spring gentleman that bubble from the pump
run across the deck and pour -PRON- out in steady spout at the lee
scupper hole

now as -PRON- well know -PRON- be not seldom the case in this conventional
world of ours watery or otherwise that when a person place in command
over -PRON- fellow man find one of -PRON- to be very significantly -PRON-
superior in general pride of manhood straightway against that man -PRON-
conceive an unconquerable dislike and bitterness and if -PRON- have a
chance -PRON- will pull down and pulverize that subaltern 's tower and
make a little heap of dust of -PRON- be this conceit of mine as -PRON- may
gentleman at all event steelkilt be a tall and noble animal with a
head like a roman and a flow golden beard like the tasseled housing
of -PRON- last viceroy 's snorting charger and a brain and a heart and
a soul in -PRON- gentleman which have make steelkilt charlemagne have -PRON-
be bear son to charlemagne 's father but radney the mate be ugly
as a mule yet as hardy as stubborn as malicious -PRON- do not love
steelkilt and steelkilt know -PRON-

espy the mate drawing near as -PRON- be toil at the pump with the
rest the lakeman affect not to notice -PRON- but unawed go on with
-PRON- gay bantering

aye aye -PRON- merry lad -PRON- be a lively leak this hold a cannikin one
of ye and let 's have a taste by the lord -PRON- be worth bottle -PRON- tell
ye what man old rad 's investment must go for -PRON- -PRON- have best cut away
-PRON- part of the hull and tow -PRON- home the fact be boy that sword fish
only begin the job -PRON- 's come back again with a gang of ship carpenter
saw fish and file fish and what not and the whole posse of 'em
be now hard at work cutting and slash at the bottom make
improvement -PRON- suppose if old rad be here now -PRON- would tell -PRON- to jump
overboard and scatter 'em -PRON- be play the devil with -PRON- estate -PRON-
can tell -PRON- but -PRON- be a simple old soul rad and a beauty too boy
-PRON- say the rest of -PRON- property be invest in look glass -PRON-
wonder if -PRON- would give a poor devil like -PRON- the model of -PRON- nose

damn -PRON- eye what be that pump stop for roar radney
pretend not to have hear the sailor talk thunder away at -PRON-

aye aye sir say steelkilt merry as a cricket lively boy
lively now and with that the pump clang like fifty fire engine
the man toss -PRON- hat off to -PRON- and ere long that peculiar gasp
of the lung be hear which denote the full tension of life 's
utmost energy

quit the pump at last with the rest of -PRON- band the lakeman go
forward all pant and sit -PRON- down on the windlass -PRON- face
fiery red -PRON- eye bloodshot and wipe the profuse sweat from -PRON-
brow now what cozen fiend -PRON- be gentleman that possess radney
to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state -PRON- know
not but so -PRON- happen intolerably stride along the deck the mate
command -PRON- to get a broom and sweep down the plank and also a
shovel and remove some offensive matter consequent upon allow a pig
to run at large

now gentleman sweep a ship 's deck at sea be a piece of household
work which in all time but rag gales be regularly attend to every
evening -PRON- have be know to be do in the case of ship actually
founder at the time such gentleman be the inflexibility of
sea usage and the instinctive love of neatness in seaman some of whom
would not willingly drown without first wash -PRON- face but in all
vessel this broom business be the prescriptive province of the boy
if boy there be aboard besides -PRON- be the strong man in the town ho
that have be divide into gang take turn at the pump and be
the most athletic seaman of -PRON- all steelkilt have be regularly
assign captain of one of the gang consequently -PRON- should have
be free from any trivial business not connect with truly nautical
duty such be the case with -PRON- comrade -PRON- mention all these
particular so that -PRON- may understand exactly how this affair stand
between the two man

but there be more than this the order about the shovel be almost as
plainly mean to sting and insult steelkilt as though radney have spat
in -PRON- face any man who have go sailor in a whale ship will
understand this and all this and doubtless much more the lakeman fully
comprehend when the mate utter -PRON- command but as -PRON- sit still for
a moment and as -PRON- steadfastly look into the mate 's malignant eye and
perceive the stack of powder cask heap up in -PRON- and the slow match
silently burn along towards -PRON- as -PRON- instinctively see all
this that strange forbearance and unwillingness to stir up the deep
passionateness in any already ireful be a repugnance most feel when
feel at all by really valiant man even when aggrieved this nameless
phantom feeling gentleman steal over steelkilt

therefore in -PRON- ordinary tone only a little break by the bodily
exhaustion -PRON- be temporarily in -PRON- answer -PRON- say that sweep
the deck be not -PRON- business and -PRON- would not do -PRON- and then without
at all allude to the shovel -PRON- point to three lad as the customary
sweeper who not be billet at the pump have do little or
nothing all day to this radney reply with an oath in a most
domineer and outrageous manner unconditionally reiterate -PRON-
command meanwhile advance upon the still seat lakeman with an
uplift cooper 's club hammer which -PRON- have snatch from a cask near by

heat and irritate as -PRON- be by -PRON- spasmodic toil at the pump for
all -PRON- first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating steelkilt
could but ill brook this bearing in the mate but somehow still
smother the conflagration within -PRON- without speak -PRON- remain
doggedly root to -PRON- seat till at last the incensed radney shake the
hammer within a few inch of -PRON- face furiously command -PRON- to do
-PRON- bidding

steelkilt rise and slowly retreat round the windlass steadily
follow by the mate with -PRON- menacing hammer deliberately repeat -PRON-
intention not to obey see however that -PRON- forbearance have not
the slight effect by an awful and unspeakable intimation with -PRON-
twisted hand -PRON- warn off the foolish and infatuated man but -PRON- be to
no purpose and in this way the two go once slowly round the windlass
when resolve at last no longer to retreat bethink -PRON- that -PRON- have
now forborne as much as comport with -PRON- humor the lakeman pause on
the hatch and thus speak to the officer

mr radney -PRON- will not obey -PRON- take that hammer away or look to
-PRON- but the predestinated mate come still close to -PRON- where
the lakeman stand fix now shake the heavy hammer within an inch of
-PRON- tooth meanwhile repeat a string of insufferable malediction
retreat not the thousandth part of an inch stab -PRON- in the eye
with the unflinching poniard of -PRON- glance steelkilt clench
-PRON- right hand behind -PRON- and creepingly draw -PRON- back tell -PRON-
persecutor that if the hammer but graze -PRON- cheek -PRON- steelkilt would
murder -PRON- but gentleman the fool have be brand for the slaughter
by the god immediately the hammer touch the cheek the next instant
the low jaw of the mate be stove in -PRON- head -PRON- fall on the hatch
spout blood like a whale

ere the cry could go aft steelkilt be shake one of the backstay
lead far aloft to where two of -PRON- comrade be stand -PRON-
masthead -PRON- be both canaller

canaller cry don pedro -PRON- have see many whale ship in -PRON-
harbour but never hear of -PRON- canaller pardon who and what be

mark antony for day and day along -PRON- green turfed flowery nile
-PRON- indolently float openly toy with -PRON- red cheeked cleopatra
ripen -PRON- apricot thigh upon the sunny deck but ashore all this
effeminacy be dash the brigandish guise which the canaller so proudly
sport -PRON- slouch and gaily ribbon hat betoken -PRON- grand feature
a terror to the smile innocence of the village through which -PRON-
float -PRON- swart visage and bold swagger be not unshunned in city
once a vagabond on -PRON- own canal -PRON- have receive good turn from one of
these canallers -PRON- thank -PRON- heartily would fain be not ungrateful
but -PRON- be often one of the prime redeem quality of -PRON- man of
violence that at time -PRON- have as stiff an arm to back a poor stranger
in a strait as to plunder a wealthy one in sum gentleman what the
wildness of this canal life be be emphatically evince by this that
-PRON- wild whale fishery contain so many of -PRON- most finished graduate
and that scarce any race of mankind except sydney man be so much
distrust by -PRON- whaling captain nor do -PRON- at all diminish the
curiousness of this matter that to many thousand of -PRON- rural boy and
young man bear along -PRON- line the probationary life of the grand canal
furnish the sole transition between quietly reap in a christian
corn field and recklessly plough the water of the most barbaric
sea

-PRON- see -PRON- see impetuously exclaim don pedro spill -PRON- chicha
upon -PRON- silvery ruffle no need to travel the world 's one lima -PRON-
have think now that at -PRON- temperate north the generation be cold
and holy as the hill but the story

-PRON- leave off gentleman where the lakeman shake the backstay hardly
have -PRON- do so when -PRON- be surround by the three junior mate and the
four harpooneer who all crowd -PRON- to the deck but slide down the
rope like baleful comet the two canallers rush into the uproar and
seek to drag -PRON- man out of -PRON- towards the forecastle other of the
sailor join with -PRON- in this attempt and a twisted turmoil ensued
while stand out of harm 's way the valiant captain dance up and down
with a whale pike call upon -PRON- officer to manhandle that atrocious
scoundrel and smoke -PRON- along to the quarter deck at interval -PRON- run
close up to the revolve border of the confusion and pry into
the heart of -PRON- with -PRON- pike seek to prick out the object of -PRON-
resentment but steelkilt and -PRON- desperado be too much for -PRON-
all -PRON- succeed in gain the forecastle deck where hastily
slew about three or four large cask in a line with the windlass
these sea parisians entrench -PRON- behind the barricade

come out of that ye pirate roar the captain now menace -PRON-
with a pistol in each hand just bring to -PRON- by the steward come
out of that ye cut throat

steelkilt leap on the barricade and stride up and down there
defy the bad the pistol could do but give the captain to
understand distinctly that -PRON- steelkilt 's death would be the signal
for a murderous mutiny on the part of all hand fear in -PRON- heart
l this may prove but too true the captain a little desisted but
still command the insurgent instantly to return to -PRON- duty

will -PRON- promise not to touch -PRON- if -PRON- do demand -PRON-
ringleader

turn to turn to!--i make no promise to -PRON- duty do -PRON- want to
sink the ship by knock off at a time like this turn to and -PRON-
once more raise a pistol

sink the ship cry steelkilt aye let -PRON- sink not a man of -PRON-
turn to unless -PRON- swear not to raise a rope yarn against -PRON- what say
ye man turn to -PRON- comrade a fierce cheer be -PRON- response

the lakeman now patrol the barricade all the while keep -PRON- eye
on the captain and jerk out such sentence as these:--'it be not -PRON-
fault -PRON- do not want -PRON- -PRON- tell -PRON- to take -PRON- hammer away -PRON- be
boy 's business -PRON- may have know -PRON- before this -PRON- tell -PRON- not to
prick the buffalo -PRON- believe -PRON- have break a finger here against -PRON-
cursed jaw be not those mince knife down in the forecastle there
man look to those handspike -PRON- heartie captain by god look to
-PRON- say the word do not be a fool forget -PRON- all -PRON- be ready
to turn to treat -PRON- decently and -PRON- be -PRON- man but -PRON- will not be
flog

turn to -PRON- make no promise turn to -PRON- say

look ye now cry the lakeman fling out -PRON- arm towards -PRON-
there be a few of -PRON- here and -PRON- be one of -PRON- who have ship
for the cruise d'ye see now as -PRON- well know sir -PRON- can claim -PRON-
discharge as soon as the anchor be down so -PRON- do not want a row -PRON- be
not -PRON- interest -PRON- want to be peaceable -PRON- be ready to work but -PRON-
will not be flog

turn to roar the captain

steelkilt glance round -PRON- a moment and then said:--'i tell -PRON- what
-PRON- be now captain rather than kill ye and be hang for such a shabby
rascal -PRON- will not lift a hand against ye unless ye attack -PRON- but till
-PRON- say the word about not flog -PRON- -PRON- do not do a hand 's turn

down into the forecastle then down with ye -PRON- will keep ye there till
ye're sick of -PRON- down ye go

shall -PRON- cry the ringleader to -PRON- man most of -PRON- be against
-PRON- but at length in obedience to steelkilt -PRON- precede -PRON- down
into -PRON- dark den growlingly disappear like bear into a cave

as the lakeman 's bare head be just level with the plank the captain
and -PRON- posse leap the barricade and rapidly draw over the slide
of the scuttle plant -PRON- group of hand upon -PRON- and loudly call
for the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock belong to the
companionway

then open the slide a little the captain whisper something
down the crack close -PRON- and turn the key upon -PRON- ten in
number leave on deck some twenty or more who thus far have remain
neutral

all night a wide awake watch be keep by all the officer forward and
aft especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway at which
last place -PRON- be fear the insurgent may emerge after break
through the bulkhead below but the hour of darkness pass in peace
the man who still remain at -PRON- duty toil hard at the pump
whose clinking and clank at interval through the dreary night
dismally resound through the ship

at sunrise the captain go forward and knock on the deck summon
the prisoner to work but with a yell -PRON- refuse water be then
lower down to -PRON- and a couple of handful of biscuit be toss
after -PRON- when again turn the key upon -PRON- and pocket -PRON- the
captain return to the quarter deck twice every day for three day
this be repeat but on the fourth morning a confused wrangling and
then a scuffling be hear as the customary summon be deliver and
suddenly four man burst up from the forecastle say -PRON- be ready
to turn to the fetid closeness of the air and a famishing diet unite
perhaps to some fear of ultimate retribution have constrain -PRON- to
surrender at discretion embolden by this the captain reiterate -PRON-
demand to the rest but steelkilt shout up to -PRON- a terrific hint to
stop -PRON- babbling and betake -PRON- where -PRON- belong on the fifth
morning three other of the mutineer bolt up into the air from the
desperate arm below that seek to restrain -PRON- only three be leave

better turn to now say the captain with a heartless jeer

shut -PRON- up again will ye cry steelkilt

oh certainly say the captain and the key click

-PRON- be at this point gentleman that enrage by the defection of seven
of -PRON- former associate and sting by the mocking voice that have last
hail -PRON- and madden by -PRON- long entombment in a place as black as
the bowel of despair -PRON- be then that steelkilt propose to the two
canaller thus far apparently of one mind with -PRON- to burst out of
-PRON- hole at the next summoning of the garrison and arm with -PRON-
keen mince knife long crescentic heavy implement with a handle
at each end run amuck from the bowsprit to the taffrail and if by any
devilishness of desperation possible seize the ship for -PRON- -PRON-
would do this -PRON- say whether -PRON- join -PRON- or not that be the
last night -PRON- should spend in that den but the scheme meet with no
opposition on the part of the other two -PRON- swear -PRON- be ready for
that or for any other mad thing for anything in short but a surrender
and what be more -PRON- each insist upon be the first man on deck
when the time to make the rush should come but to this -PRON- leader as
fiercely object reserve that priority for -PRON- particularly as
-PRON- two comrade would not yield the one to the other in the matter
and both of -PRON- could not be first for the ladder would but admit one
man at a time and here gentleman the foul play of these miscreant
must come out

upon hear the frantic project of -PRON- leader each in -PRON- own
separate soul have suddenly light -PRON- would seem upon the same piece
of treachery namely to be foremost in break out in order to be
the first of the three though the last of the ten to surrender and
thereby secure whatev small chance of pardon such conduct may merit
but when steelkilt make know -PRON- determination still to lead -PRON- to
the last -PRON- in some way by some subtle chemistry of villany mixed
-PRON- before secret treachery together and when -PRON- leader
fall into a doze verbally open -PRON- soul to each other in three
sentence and bind the sleeper with cord and gag -PRON- with cord
and shriek out for the captain at midnight

think murder at hand and smell in the dark for the blood -PRON- and
all -PRON- armed mate and harpooneer rush for the forecastle in a
few minute the scuttle be open and bind hand and foot the still
struggle ringleader be shove up into the air by -PRON- perfidious
ally who at once claim the honour of secure a man who have be
fully ripe for murder but all these be collared and drag along
the deck like dead cattle and side by side be seize up into the
mizzen rigging like three quarter of meat and there -PRON- hang till
morning damn ye cry the captain pace to and fro before -PRON-
the vulture would not touch ye ye villain

at sunrise -PRON- summon all hand and separate those who have rebel
from those who have take no part in the mutiny -PRON- tell the former that
-PRON- have a good mind to flog -PRON- all round thought upon the whole
-PRON- would do so -PRON- ought to justice demand -PRON- but for the present
consider -PRON- timely surrender -PRON- would let -PRON- go with a
reprimand which -PRON- accordingly administer in the vernacular

but as for -PRON- ye carrion rogue turn to the three man in the
rigging--'for -PRON- -PRON- mean to mince ye up for the try pot and
seize a rope -PRON- apply -PRON- with all -PRON- might to the back of the
two traitor till -PRON- yell no more but lifelessly hang -PRON- head
sideways as the two crucify thief be draw

-PRON- wrist be sprain with ye -PRON- cry at last but there be still
rope enough leave for -PRON- -PRON- fine bantam that would not give up take
that gag from -PRON- mouth and let -PRON- hear what -PRON- can say for -PRON-

for a moment the exhausted mutineer make a tremulous motion of -PRON-
cramped jaw and then painfully twist round -PRON- head say in a sort
of hiss what -PRON- say be this and mind -PRON- well if -PRON- flog -PRON- -PRON- murder
-PRON-

say ye so then see how ye frighten me'--and the captain draw off with
the rope to strike

best not hiss the lakeman

but -PRON- must,'--and the rope be once more draw back for the stroke

steelkilt here hiss out something inaudible to all but the captain
who to the amazement of all hand start back pace the deck rapidly
two or three time and then suddenly throw down -PRON- rope say -PRON-
will not do -PRON- let -PRON- go cut -PRON- down d'ye hear

but as the junior mate be hurry to execute the order a pale man
with a bandaged head arrest -PRON- radney the chief mate ever since
the blow -PRON- have lie in -PRON- berth but that morning hear the tumult
on the deck -PRON- have creep out and thus far have watch the whole
scene such be the state of -PRON- mouth that -PRON- could hardly speak
but mumble something about -PRON- be willing and able to do what the
captain dare not attempt -PRON- snatch the rope and advanced to -PRON-
pinion foe

-PRON- be a coward hiss the lakeman

so -PRON- be but take that the mate be in the very act of strike
when another hiss stay -PRON- uplifted arm -PRON- pause and then pause
no more make good -PRON- word spite of steelkilt 's threat whatev that
may have be the three man be then cut down all hand be turn
to and sullenly work by the moody seaman the iron pump clang as
before

just after dark that day when one watch have retire below a clamor
be hear in the forecastle and the two tremble traitor run up
besiege the cabin door say -PRON- durst not consort with the crew
entreaty cuff and kick could not drive -PRON- back so at -PRON- own
instance -PRON- be put down in the ship 's run for salvation still no
sign of mutiny reappear among the rest on the contrary -PRON- seem
that mainly at steelkilt 's instigation -PRON- have resolve to maintain
the strict peacefulness obey all order to the last and when the
ship reach port desert -PRON- in a body but in order to insure the
speedy end to the voyage -PRON- all agree to another thing namely
not to sing out for whale in case any should be discover for
spite of -PRON- leak and spite of all -PRON- other peril the town ho still
maintain -PRON- mast head and -PRON- captain be just as willing to
low for a fish that moment as on the day -PRON- craft first strike the
cruise ground and radney the mate be quite as ready to change -PRON-
berth for a boat and with -PRON- bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the
vital jaw of the whale

but though the lakeman have induce the seamen to adopt this sort of
passiveness in -PRON- conduct -PRON- keep -PRON- own counsel at least till all
be over concern -PRON- own proper and private revenge upon the man who
have sting -PRON- in the ventricle of -PRON- heart -PRON- be in radney the chief
mate 's watch and as if the infatuated man seek to run more than
half way to meet -PRON- doom after the scene at the rigging -PRON- insist
against the express counsel of the captain upon resume the head
of -PRON- watch at night upon this and one or two other circumstance
steelkilt systematically build the plan of -PRON- revenge

during the night radney have an unseamanlike way of sit on the
bulwark of the quarter deck and lean -PRON- arm upon the gunwale of
the boat which be hoist up there a little above the ship 's side
in this attitude -PRON- be well know -PRON- sometimes doze there be a
considerable vacancy between the boat and the ship and down between
this be the sea steelkilt calculate -PRON- time and find that -PRON- next
trick at the helm would come round at two o'clock in the morning of the
third day from that in which -PRON- have be betray at -PRON- leisure
-PRON- employ the interval in braid something very carefully in -PRON-
watch below

what be -PRON- make there say a shipmate

what do -PRON- think what do -PRON- look like

like a lanyard for -PRON- bag but -PRON- be an odd one seem to -PRON-

yes rather oddish say the lakeman hold -PRON- at arm 's length
before -PRON- but -PRON- think -PRON- will answer shipmate -PRON- haven't enough
twine have -PRON- any

but there be none in the forecastle

then -PRON- must get some from old rad and -PRON- rise to go aft

-PRON- do not mean to go a begging to him say a sailor

why not do -PRON- think -PRON- will not do -PRON- a turn when -PRON- be to help -PRON-
in the end shipmate and go to the mate -PRON- look at -PRON-
quietly and ask -PRON- for some twine to mend -PRON- hammock -PRON- be give
-PRON- neither twine nor lanyard be see again but the next night
an iron ball closely net partly roll from the pocket of the
lakeman 's monkey jacket as -PRON- be tuck the coat into -PRON- hammock for
a pillow twenty four hour after -PRON- trick at the silent helm nigh
to the man who be apt to doze over the grave always ready dig to
the seaman 's hand that fatal hour be then to come and in the
fore ordain soul of steelkilt the mate be already stark and
stretch as a corpse with -PRON- forehead crush in

but gentleman a fool save the would be murderer from the bloody
deed -PRON- have plan yet complete revenge -PRON- have and without be the
avenger for by a mysterious fatality heaven -PRON- seem to step in
to take out of -PRON- hand into -PRON- own the damning thing -PRON- would have
do

-PRON- be just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the second
day when -PRON- be wash down the deck that a stupid teneriffe man
draw water in the main chain all at once shout out there -PRON-
roll there -PRON- roll jesu what a whale -PRON- be moby dick

moby dick cry don sebastian st. dominic sir sailor but do
whale have christening whom call -PRON- moby dick

a very white and famous and most deadly immortal monster don but
that would be too long a story

how how cry all the young spaniards crowd

nay don don nay nay -PRON- can not rehearse that now let -PRON- get more
into the air sirs

the chicha the chicha cry don pedro -PRON- vigorous friend look
faint fill up -PRON- empty glass

no need gentleman one moment and -PRON- proce now gentleman
so suddenly perceive the snowy whale within fifty yard of the
ship forgetful of the compact among the crew in the excitement of the
moment the teneriffe man have instinctively and involuntarily lift
-PRON- voice for the monster though for some little time past -PRON- have be
plainly beheld from the three sullen mast head all be now a phrensy
the white whale the white whale be the cry from captain mate
and harpooneer who undeterr by fearful rumour be all anxious
to capture so famous and precious a fish while the dog crew eye
askance and with curse the appalling beauty of the vast milky mass
that light up by a horizontal spangle sun shift and glisten like
a live opal in the blue morning sea gentlemen a strange fatality
pervade the whole career of these event as if verily map out
before the world -PRON- be chart the mutineer be the bowsman of the
mate and when fast to a fish -PRON- be -PRON- duty to sit next -PRON- while
radney stand up with -PRON- lance in the prow and haul in or slacken
the line at the word of command moreover when the four boat be
lower the mate be get the start and none howl more fiercely with
delight than do steelkilt as -PRON- strain at -PRON- oar after a stiff
pull -PRON- harpooneer get fast and spear in hand radney spring to
the bow -PRON- be always a furious man -PRON- seem in a boat and now -PRON-
bandaged cry be to beach -PRON- on the whale 's topmost back nothing
loath -PRON- bowsman haul -PRON- up and up through a blind foam that
blent two whiteness together till of a sudden the boat strike as
against a sunken ledge and keel over spill out the standing mate
that instant as -PRON- fall on the whale 's slippery back the boat right
and be dash aside by the swell while radney be toss over into the
sea on the other flank of the whale -PRON- strike out through the spray
and for an instant be dimly see through that veil wildly seek to
remove -PRON- from the eye of moby dick but the whale rush round
in a sudden maelstrom seize the swimmer between -PRON- jaws and rear
high up with -PRON- plunge headlong again and go down

meantime at the first tap of the boat 's bottom the lakeman have
slacken the line so as to drop astern from the whirlpool calmly
look on -PRON- think -PRON- own thought but a sudden terrific
downward jerking of the boat quickly bring -PRON- knife to the line -PRON-
cut -PRON- and the whale be free but at some distance moby dick rise
again with some tatter of radney 's red woollen shirt catch in the
tooth that have destroy -PRON- all four boat give chase again but the
whale elude -PRON- and finally wholly disappear

in good time the town ho reach -PRON- port a savage solitary
place where no civilized creature reside there head by the
lakeman all but five or six of the foremastman deliberately desert
among the palm eventually as -PRON- turn out seize a large double
war canoe of the savage and set sail for some other harbor

the ship 's company be reduce to but a handful the captain call
upon the islanders to assist -PRON- in the laborious business of heave
down the ship to stop the leak but to such unresting vigilance over
-PRON- dangerous ally be this small band of white necessitate both
by night and by day and so extreme be the hard work -PRON- undergo
that upon the vessel be ready again for sea -PRON- be in such a
weakened condition that the captain durst not put off with -PRON- in so
heavy a vessel after take counsel with -PRON- officer -PRON- anchor the
ship as far off shore as possible load and run out -PRON- two cannon
from the bow stack -PRON- musket on the poop and warn the
islander not to approach the ship at -PRON- peril take one man with
-PRON- and set the sail of -PRON- good whale boat steer straight
before the wind for tahiti five hundred mile distant to procure a
reinforcement to -PRON- crew

on the fourth day of the sail a large canoe be descry which seem
to have touch at a low isle of coral -PRON- steer away from -PRON- but
the savage craft bear down on -PRON- and soon the voice of steelkilt
hail -PRON- to heave to or -PRON- would run -PRON- under water the captain
present a pistol with one foot on each prow of the yoke war canoe
the lakeman laugh -PRON- to scorn assure -PRON- that if the pistol so
much as click in the lock -PRON- would bury -PRON- in bubble and foam

what do -PRON- want of -PRON- cry the captain

where be -PRON- bind and for what be -PRON- bind demand steelkilt
no lie

-PRON- be bind to tahiti for more man

very good let -PRON- board -PRON- a moment -PRON- come in peace with that -PRON-
leap from the canoe swim to the boat and climb the gunwale stand
face to face with the captain

cross -PRON- arm sir throw back -PRON- head now repeat after -PRON-
as soon as steelkilt leave -PRON- -PRON- swear to beach this boat on yonder
island and remain there six day if -PRON- do not may lightning strike
-PRON-

a pretty scholar laugh the lakeman adios senor and leap
into the sea -PRON- swim back to -PRON- comrade

watch the boat till -PRON- be fairly beached and draw up to the
root of the cocoa nut tree steelkilt make sail again and in due time
arrive at tahiti -PRON- own place of destination there luck befriend
-PRON- two ship be about to sail for france and be providentially
in want of precisely that number of man which the sailor head -PRON-
embark and so for ever get the start of -PRON- former captain have -PRON-
be at all minded to work -PRON- legal retribution

and the captain be force to enlist some of the more civilized
tahitians who have be somewhat used to the sea charter a small
native schooner -PRON- return with -PRON- to -PRON- vessel and find all

chapter 55 of the monstrous pictures of whales


-PRON- shall ere long paint to -PRON- as well as one can without canvas
something like the true form of the whale as -PRON- actually appear to the
eye of the whaleman when in -PRON- own absolute body the whale be moor
alongside the whale ship so that -PRON- can be fairly step upon there
-PRON- may be worth while therefore previously to advert to those
curious imaginary portrait of -PRON- which even down to the present day
confidently challenge the faith of the landsman -PRON- be time to set the
world right in this matter by prove such picture of the whale all
wrong

-PRON- may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusion will
be find among the old hindoo egyptian and grecian sculpture for
ever since those inventive but unscrupulous time when on the marble
panelling of temple the pedestal of statue and on shield
medallion cup and coin the dolphin be draw in scale of
chain armor like saladin 's and a helmeted head like st. george 's ever
since then have something of the same sort of license prevail not
only in most popular picture of the whale but in many scientific
presentation of -PRON-

now by all odd the most ancient extant portrait anyways purport to
be the whale 's be to be find in the famous cavern pagoda of elephanta
in india the brahmins maintain that in the almost endless sculpture of
that immemorial pagoda all the trade and pursuit every conceivable
avocation of man be prefigure age before any of -PRON- actually come
into be no wonder then that in some sort -PRON- noble profession of
whaling should have be there shadow forth the hindoo whale
refer to occur in a separate department of the wall depict the
incarnation of vishnu in the form of leviathan learnedly know as the
matse avatar but though this sculpture be half man and half whale so
as only to give the tail of the latter yet that small section of -PRON- be
all wrong -PRON- look more like the taper tail of an anaconda than the
broad palm of the true whale 's majestic fluke

but go to the old galleries and look now at a great christian painter 's
portrait of this fish for -PRON- succeed no good than the antediluvian
hindoo -PRON- be guido 's picture of perseus rescue andromeda from the
sea monster or whale where do guido get the model of such a strange
creature as that nor do hogarth in paint the same scene in -PRON-
own perseus descending make out one whit good the huge corpulence
of that hogarthian monster undulate on the surface scarcely draw
one inch of water -PRON- have a sort of howdah on -PRON- back and -PRON-
distend tusked mouth into which the billow be roll may be
take for the traitors gate lead from the thames by water into the
tower then there be the prodromus whale of old scotch sibbald and
jonah 's whale as depict in the print of old bible and the cut of
old primer what shall be say of these as for the book binder 's whale
wind like a vine stalk round the stock of a descend anchor as
stamp and gilded on the back and title page of many book both
old and new that be a very picturesque but purely fabulous creature
imitate -PRON- take -PRON- from the like figure on antique vas
though universally denominate a dolphin -PRON- nevertheless call this
book binder 's fish an attempt at a whale because -PRON- be so intended
when the device be first introduce -PRON- be introduce by an old
italian publisher somewhere about the 15th century during the revival
of learning and in those day and even down to a comparatively
late period dolphin be popularly suppose to be a specie of the
leviathan

in the vignette and other embellishment of some ancient book -PRON- will
at time meet with very curious touch at the whale where all manner
of spout jet d'eau hot spring and cold saratoga and baden baden
come bubble up from -PRON- unexhausted brain in the title page of the
original edition of the advancement of learning -PRON- will find some
curious whale

but quit all these unprofessional attempt let -PRON- glance at those
picture of leviathan purport to be sober scientific delineation
by those who know in old harris 's collection of voyage there be some
plate of whale extract from a dutch book of voyage a.d. 1671
entitled a whaling voyage to spitzbergen in the ship jonas in the
whale peter peterson of friesland master in one of those plate the
whale like great raft of log be represent lie among ice isle
with white bear run over -PRON- live back in another plate the
prodigious blunder be make of represent the whale with perpendicular
fluke

then again there be an impose quarto write by one captain colnett
a post captain in the english navy entitled a voyage round cape horn
into the south seas for the purpose of extend the spermaceti whale
fishery in this book be an outline purport to be a picture of
a physeter or spermaceti whale draw by scale from one kill on the
coast of mexico august 1793 and hoist on deck -PRON- doubt not the
captain have this veracious picture take for the benefit of -PRON- marine
to mention but one thing about -PRON- let -PRON- say that -PRON- have an eye which
apply accord to the accompany scale to a full grown sperm
whale would make the eye of that whale a bow window some five foot
long ah -PRON- gallant captain why do ye not give -PRON- jonah look out
of that eye

nor be the most conscientious compilation of natural history for
the benefit of the young and tender free from the same heinousness of
mistake look at that popular work goldsmith 's animated nature in the
abridged london edition of 1807 there be plate of an allege whale
and a narwhale -PRON- do not wish to seem inelegant but this unsightly
whale look much like an amputated sow and as for the narwhale one
glimpse at -PRON- be enough to amaze one that in this nineteenth century
such a hippogriff could be palm for genuine upon any intelligent
public of schoolboy

then again in 1825 bernard germain count de lacepede a great
naturalist publish a scientific systemize whale book wherein be
several picture of the different specie of the leviathan all these
be not only incorrect but the picture of the mysticetus or greenland
whale that be to say the right whale even scoresby a long
experienced man as touch that specie declare not to have -PRON-
counterpart in nature

but the placing of the cap sheaf to all this blundering business be
reserve for the scientific frederick cuvier brother to the famous
baron in 1836 -PRON- publish a natural history of whales in which -PRON-
give what -PRON- call a picture of the sperm whale before show that
picture to any nantucketer -PRON- have best provide for -PRON- summary
retreat from nantucket in a word frederick cuvier 's sperm whale be not
a sperm whale but a squash of course -PRON- never have the benefit of
a whaling voyage such man seldom have but whence -PRON- derive that
picture who can tell perhaps -PRON- get -PRON- as -PRON- scientific predecessor
in the same field desmarest get one of -PRON- authentic abortion that
be from a chinese drawing and what sort of lively lad with the pencil
those chinese be many queer cup and saucer inform -PRON-

as for the sign painter whale see in the street hang over the
shop of oil dealer what shall be say of -PRON- -PRON- be generally
richard iii whale with dromedary hump and very savage breakfast
on three or four sailor tart that be whaleboat full of mariner
-PRON- deformity flounder in sea of blood and blue paint

but these manifold mistake in depict the whale be not so very
surprising after all consider most of the scientific drawing have
be take from the stranded fish and these be about as correct as a
drawing of a wreck ship with break back would correctly represent
the noble animal -PRON- in all -PRON- undashed pride of hull and spar
though elephant have stand for -PRON- full length the living leviathan
have never yet fairly float -PRON- for -PRON- portrait the live whale
in -PRON- full majesty and significance be only to be see at sea in
unfathomable water and afloat the vast bulk of -PRON- be out of sight
like a launch line of battle ship and out of that element -PRON- be a
thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist -PRON- bodily into the
air so as to preserve all -PRON- mighty swell and undulation and not
to speak of the highly presumable difference of contour between a young
suck whale and a full grown platonian leviathan yet even in the
case of one of those young sucking whale hoist to a ship 's deck such
be then the outlandish eel like limber vary shape of -PRON- that
-PRON- precise expression the devil -PRON- could not catch

but -PRON- may be fancy that from the naked skeleton of the strand
whale accurate hint may be derive touch -PRON- true form not at all
for -PRON- be one of the more curious thing about this leviathan that
-PRON- skeleton give very little idea of -PRON- general shape though jeremy
bentham 's skeleton which hang for candelabra in the library of one of
-PRON- executor correctly convey the idea of a burly brow utilitarian
old gentleman with all jeremy 's other lead personal characteristic
yet nothing of this kind could be infer from any leviathan 's
articulate bone in fact as the great hunter say the mere skeleton
of the whale bear the same relation to the fully invest and pad
animal as the insect do to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelope
-PRON- this peculiarity be strikingly evince in the head as in some
part of this book will be incidentally show -PRON- be also very curiously
display in the side fin the bone of which almost exactly answer to
the bone of the human hand minus only the thumb this fin have four
regular bone finger the index middle ring and little finger but
all these be permanently lodge in -PRON- fleshy covering as the human
finger in an artificial covering however recklessly the whale may
sometimes serve -PRON- say humorous stubb one day -PRON- can never be truly
say to handle -PRON- without mitten

for all these reason then any way -PRON- may look at -PRON- -PRON- must need
conclude that the great leviathan be that one creature in the world
which must remain unpainted to the last true one portrait may hit
the mark much near than another but none can hit -PRON- with any very
considerable degree of exactness so there be no earthly way of find
out precisely what the whale really look like and the only mode in
which -PRON- can derive even a tolerable idea of -PRON- live contour be
by go a whaling -PRON- but by so do -PRON- run no small risk of
be eternally stove and sink by -PRON- wherefore -PRON- seem to -PRON- -PRON- have
good not be too fastidious in -PRON- curiosity touch this leviathan



chapter 56 of the less erroneous pictures of whales and the true
picture of whaling scenes


in connexion with the monstrous picture of whale -PRON- be strongly
tempt here to enter upon those still more monstrous story of
-PRON- which be to be find in certain book both ancient and modern
especially in pliny purchas hackluyt harris cuvier etc but -PRON- pas
that matter by

-PRON- know of only four publish outline of the great sperm whale
colnett 's huggins 's frederick cuvier 's and beale 's in the previous
chapter colnett and cuvier have be refer to huggins 's be far
good than -PRON- but by great odd beale 's be the good all beale 's
drawing of this whale be good except the middle figure in the
picture of three whale in various attitude cap -PRON- second
chapter -PRON- frontispiece boat attack sperm whales though no
doubt calculate to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor man be
admirably correct and life like in -PRON- general effect some of the sperm
whale drawing in j. ross browne be pretty correct in contour but -PRON-
be wretchedly engrave that be not -PRON- fault though

of the right whale the good outline picture be in scoresby but -PRON-
be draw on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression -PRON- have
but one picture of whaling scene and this be a sad deficiency because
-PRON- be by such picture only when at all well do that -PRON- can derive
anything like a truthful idea of the live whale as see by -PRON- live
hunter

but take for all in all by far the fine though in some detail
not the most correct presentation of whale and whale scene to
be anywhere find be two large french engraving well execute
and take from painting by one garnery respectively -PRON- represent
attack on the sperm and right whale in the first engraving a noble
sperm whale be depict in full majesty of might just rise beneath
the boat from the profundity of the ocean and bear high in the air
upon -PRON- back the terrific wreck of the stoven plank the prow of
the boat be partially unbroken and be draw just balance upon
the monster 's spine and stand in that prow for that one single
incomputable flash of time -PRON- behold an oarsman half shroud by the
incensed boil spout of the whale and in the act of leap as if
from a precipice the action of the whole thing be wonderfully good and
true the half empty line tub float on the whitened sea the wooden
pole of the spill harpoon obliquely bob in -PRON- the head of the
swimming crew be scatter about the whale in contrast expression
of affright while in the black stormy distance the ship be bear down
upon the scene serious fault may be find with the anatomical detail
of this whale but let that pass since for the life of -PRON- -PRON- could not
draw so good a one

in the second engraving the boat be in the act of draw alongside
the barnacled flank of a large running right whale that roll -PRON- black
weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock slide from the patagonian
cliff -PRON- jet be erect full and black like soot so that from so
abound a smoke in the chimney -PRON- would think there must be a brave
supper cooking in the great bowel below sea fowl be peck at the
small crab shell fish and other sea candy and maccaroni which the
right whale sometimes carry on -PRON- pestilent back and all the while
the thick lipped leviathan be rush through the deep leave ton of
tumultuous white curd in -PRON- wake and cause the slight boat to rock
in the swell like a skiff catch nigh the paddle wheel of an ocean
steamer thus the foreground be all rag commotion but behind in
admirable artistic contrast be the glassy level of a sea becalm the
droop unstarched sail of the powerless ship and the inert mass of
a dead whale a conquered fortress with the flag of capture lazily
hang from the whale pole insert into -PRON- spout hole

who garnery the painter be or be -PRON- know not but -PRON- life for -PRON- -PRON-
be either practically conversant with -PRON- subject or else marvellously
tutor by some experienced whaleman the french be the lad for
paint action go and gaze upon all the painting of europe and
where will -PRON- find such a gallery of living and breathe commotion
on canvas as in that triumphal hall at versailles where the beholder
fight -PRON- way pell mell through the consecutive great battle of
france where every sword seem a flash of the northern lights and the
successive armed king and emperor dash by like a charge of crown
centaur not wholly unworthy of a place in that gallery be these sea
battle piece of garnery

the natural aptitude of the french for seize the picturesqueness of
thing seem to be peculiarly evince in what painting and engraving
-PRON- have of -PRON- whaling scene with not one tenth of england 's
experience in the fishery and not the thousandth part of that of the
americans -PRON- have nevertheless furnish both nation with the only
finished sketch at all capable of convey the real spirit of
the whale hunt for the most part the english and american whale
draughtsman seem entirely content with present the mechanical outline
of thing such as the vacant profile of the whale which so far as
picturesqueness of effect be concern be about tantamount to sketch
the profile of a pyramid even scoresby the justly renowned right
whaleman after give -PRON- a stiff full length of the greenland whale
and three or four delicate miniature of narwhale and porpoise treat
-PRON- to a series of classical engraving of boat hook chop knife
and grapnel and with the microscopic diligence of a leuwenhoeck
submit to the inspection of a shivering world ninety six fac simile of
magnify arctic snow crystal -PRON- mean no disparagement to the excellent
voyager -PRON- honour -PRON- for a veteran but in so important a matter -PRON-
be certainly an oversight not to have procure for every crystal a
swear affidavit take before a greenland justice of the peace

in addition to those fine engraving from garnery there be two other
french engraving worthy of note by some one who subscribe -PRON-
h. durand one of -PRON- though not precisely adapt to -PRON- present
purpose nevertheless deserve mention on other account -PRON- be a quiet
noon scene among the isle of the pacific a french whaler anchor
inshore in a calm and lazily take water on board the loosen sail
of the ship and the long leaf of the palm in the background both
droop together in the breezeless air the effect be very fine when
consider with reference to -PRON- present the hardy fisherman under
one of -PRON- few aspect of oriental repose the other engraving be
quite a different affair the ship hove to upon the open sea and in the
very heart of the leviathanic life with a right whale alongside the
vessel in the act of cut in hove over to the monster as if to a
quay and a boat hurriedly push off from this scene of activity be
about give chase to whale in the distance the harpoon and lance
lie level for use three oarsman be just set the mast in -PRON-
hole while from a sudden roll of the sea the little craft stand
half erect out of the water like a rear horse from the ship the
smoke of the torment of the boil whale be go up like the smoke
over a village of smithy and to windward a black cloud rise up
with earnest of squall and rain seem to quicken the activity of the
excited seaman



chapter 57 of whales in paint in teeth in wood in sheet iron in
stone in mountains in stars


on tower hill as -PRON- go down to the london dock -PRON- may have see a
crippled beggar or kedger as the sailor say hold a paint board
before -PRON- represent the tragic scene in which -PRON- lose -PRON- leg
there be three whale and three boat and one of the boat presume
to contain the miss leg in all -PRON- original integrity be be
crunch by the jaw of the foremost whale any time these ten year
-PRON- tell -PRON- have that man hold up that picture and exhibit that
stump to an incredulous world but the time of -PRON- justification have
now come -PRON- three whale be as good whale as be ever publish in
wapping at any rate and -PRON- stump as unquestionable a stump as any -PRON-
will find in the western clearing but though for ever mount on
that stump never a stump speech do the poor whaleman make but with
downcast eye stand ruefully contemplate -PRON- own amputation

throughout the pacific and also in nantucket and new bedford and
sag harbor -PRON- will come across lively sketch of whale and
whaling scene grave by the fisherman -PRON- on sperm whale tooth
or lady busk work out of the right whale bone and other
like skrimshander article as the whaleman call the numerous little
ingenious contrivance -PRON- elaborately carve out of the rough material
in -PRON- hour of ocean leisure some of -PRON- have little box
of dentistical look implement specially intend for the
skrimshander business but in general -PRON- toil with -PRON-
jack knife alone and with that almost omnipotent tool of the sailor
-PRON- will turn -PRON- out anything -PRON- please in the way of a mariner 's
fancy

long exile from christendom and civilization inevitably restore a man
to that condition in which god place -PRON- i.e. what be call savagery
-PRON- true whale hunter be as much a savage as an iroquois -PRON- -PRON- be a
savage own no allegiance but to the king of the cannibals and ready
at any moment to rebel against -PRON-

now one of the peculiar characteristic of the savage in -PRON- domestic
hour be -PRON- wonderful patience of industry an ancient hawaiian
war club or spear paddle in -PRON- full multiplicity and elaboration of
carving be as great a trophy of human perseverance as a latin lexicon
for with but a bit of broken sea shell or a shark 's tooth that
miraculous intricacy of wooden net work have be achieve and -PRON- have
cost steady year of steady application

as with the hawaiian savage so with the white sailor savage with the
same marvellous patience and with the same single shark 's tooth of
-PRON- one poor jack knife -PRON- will carve -PRON- a bit of bone sculpture not
quite as workmanlike but as close pack in -PRON- maziness of design
as the greek savage achilles 's shield and full of barbaric spirit
and suggestiveness as the print of that fine old dutch savage albert
durer

wooden whale or whale cut in profile out of the small dark slab of
the noble south sea war wood be frequently meet with in the forecastle
of american whaler some of -PRON- be do with much accuracy

at some old gable roof country house -PRON- will see brass whale hang
by the tail for knocker to the road side door when the porter be
sleepy the anvil head whale would be best but these knock
whale be seldom remarkable as faithful essay on the spire of some
old fashioned church -PRON- will see sheet iron whale place there for
weather cock but -PRON- be so elevated and besides that be to all
intent and purpose so label with hands off -PRON- can not examine
-PRON- closely enough to decide upon -PRON- merit

in bony ribby region of the earth where at the base of high break
cliff mass of rock lie strew in fantastic grouping upon the
plain -PRON- will often discover image as of the petrified form of the
leviathan partly merge in grass which of a windy day break against
-PRON- in a surf of green surge

then again in mountainous country where the traveller be continually
girdle by amphitheatrical height here and there from some lucky
point of view -PRON- will catch pass glimpse of the profile of
whale define along the undulating ridge but -PRON- must be a thorough
whaleman to see these sight and not only that but if -PRON- wish
to return to such a sight again -PRON- must be sure and take the exact
intersect latitude and longitude of -PRON- first stand point else
so chance like be such observation of the hill that -PRON- precise
previous stand point would require a laborious re discovery like the
soloma islands which still remain incognita though once high ruffed
mendanna tread -PRON- and old figuera chronicle -PRON-

nor when expandingly lift by -PRON- subject can -PRON- fail to trace out
great whale in the starry heaven and boat in pursuit of -PRON- as
when long fill with thought of war the eastern nation see army
lock in battle among the cloud thus at the north have -PRON- chase
leviathan round and round the pole with the revolution of the bright
point that first define -PRON- to -PRON- and beneath the effulgent antarctic
sky -PRON- have board the argo navis and join the chase against the
starry cetus far beyond the utmost stretch of hydrus and the flying
fish

with a frigate 's anchor for -PRON- bridle bitts and fasce of harpoon for
spur would -PRON- could mount that whale and leap the topmost sky to
see whether the fabled heaven with all -PRON- countless tent really lie
encamped beyond -PRON- mortal sight



chapter 58 brit


steer north eastward from the crozetts -PRON- fall in with vast meadow
of brit the minute yellow substance upon which the right whale
largely feed for league and league -PRON- undulated round -PRON- so that -PRON-
seem to be sail through boundless field of ripe and golden wheat

on the second day number of right whales be see who secure from
the attack of a sperm whaler like the pequod with open jaw sluggishly
swim through the brit which adhere to the fringing fibre of that
wondrous venetian blind in -PRON- mouth be in that manner separate
from the water that escape at the lip

as morning mower who side by side slowly and seethingly advance
-PRON- scythe through the long wet grass of marshy mead even so these
monster swim make a strange grassy cut sound and leave
behind -PRON- endless swath of blue upon the yellow sea


that part of the sea know among whaleman as the brazil banks do
not bear that name as the banks of newfoundland do because of there
be shallow and sounding there but because of this remarkable
meadow like appearance cause by the vast drift of brit continually
float in those latitude where the right whale be often chase


but -PRON- be only the sound -PRON- make as -PRON- part the brit which at all
remind one of mower see from the mast head especially when -PRON-
pause and be stationary for a while -PRON- vast black form look
more like lifeless mass of rock than anything else and as in the
great hunting country of india the stranger at a distance will
sometimes pass on the plain recumbent elephant without know -PRON-
to be such take -PRON- for bare blacken elevation of the soil even
so often with -PRON- who for the first time behold this specie of the
leviathan of the sea and even when recognise at last -PRON- immense
magnitude render -PRON- very hard really to believe that such bulky mass
of overgrowth can possibly be instinct in all part with the same sort
of life that live in a dog or a horse

indeed in other respect -PRON- can hardly regard any creature of the
deep with the same feeling that -PRON- do those of the shore for though
some old naturalist have maintain that all creature of the land be
of -PRON- kind in the sea and though take a broad general view of
the thing this may very well be yet come to specialty where for
example do the ocean furnish any fish that in disposition answer to
the sagacious kindness of the dog the accursed shark alone can in any
generic respect be say to bear comparative analogy to -PRON-

but though to landsman in general the native inhabitant of the
sea have ever be regard with emotion unspeakably unsocial and
repel though -PRON- know the sea to be an everlasting terra incognita
so that columbus sail over numberless unknown world to discover -PRON-
one superficial western one though by vast odd the most terrific
of all mortal disaster have immemorially and indiscriminately befall
ten and hundred of thousand of those who have go upon the water
though but a moment 's consideration will teach that however baby man
may brag of -PRON- science and skill and however much in a flattering
future that science and skill may augment yet for ever and for ever
to the crack of doom the sea will insult and murder -PRON- and pulverize
the stately stiff frigate -PRON- can make nevertheless by the
continual repetition of these very impression man have lose that sense
of the full awfulness of the sea which aboriginally belong to -PRON-

the first boat -PRON- read of float on an ocean that with portuguese
vengeance have whelm a whole world without leave so much as a widow
that same ocean roll now that same ocean destroy the wrecked ship
of last year yea foolish mortal noah 's flood be not yet subside
two third of the fair world -PRON- yet cover

wherein differ the sea and the land that a miracle upon one be not a
miracle upon the other preternatural terror rest upon the hebrews
when under the foot of korah and -PRON- company the live ground open
and swallow -PRON- up for ever yet not a modern sun ever set but in
precisely the same manner the live sea swallow up ship and crew

but not only be the sea such a foe to man who be an alien to -PRON- but -PRON-
be also a fiend to -PRON- own off spring bad than the persian host who
murder -PRON- own guest spar not the creature which -PRON- hath
spawn like a savage tigress that toss in the jungle overlay -PRON-
own cub so the sea dash even the mighty whale against the rock
and leave -PRON- there side by side with the split wreck of ship no
mercy no power but -PRON- own control -PRON- pant and snort like a mad
battle steed that have lose -PRON- rider the masterless ocean overrun the
globe

consider the subtleness of the sea how -PRON- most dreaded creature glide
under water unapparent for the most part and treacherously hide
beneath the lovely tint of azure consider also the devilish
brilliance and beauty of many of -PRON- most remorseless tribe as the
dainty embellished shape of many specie of shark consider once more
the universal cannibalism of the sea all whose creature prey upon each
other carry on eternal war since the world begin

consider all this and then turn to this green gentle and most docile
earth consider -PRON- both the sea and the land and do -PRON- not find a
strange analogy to something in -PRON- for as this appal ocean
surround the verdant land so in the soul of man there lie one insular
tahiti full of peace and joy but encompass by all the horror of the
half know life god keep thee push not off from that isle thou canst
never return


chapter 59 squid


slowly wad through the meadow of brit the pequod still hold on -PRON-
way north eastward towards the island of java a gentle air impel
-PRON- keel so that in the surround serenity -PRON- three tall taper
mast mildly wave to that languid breeze as three mild palm on a
plain and still at wide interval in the silvery night the lonely
alluring jet would be see

but one transparent blue morning when a stillness almost preternatural
spread over the sea however unattended with any stagnant calm when
the long burnish sun glade on the water seem a golden finger lay
across -PRON- enjoin some secrecy when the slipper wave whisper
together as -PRON- softly run on in this profound hush of the visible
sphere a strange spectre be see by daggoo from the main mast head

in the distance a great white mass lazily rise and rise higher and
high and disentangle -PRON- from the azure at last gleam before
-PRON- prow like a snow slide new slide from the hill thus glisten
for a moment as slowly -PRON- subside and sink then once more arise
and silently gleam -PRON- seem not a whale and yet be this moby dick
think daggoo again the phantom go down but on re appear once
more with a stiletto like cry that startle every man from -PRON- nod the
negro yell out--"there there again there -PRON- breach right ahead
the white whale the white whale

upon this the seaman rush to the yard arm as in swarm time the
bee rush to the bough bare head in the sultry sun ahab stand on
the bowsprit and with one hand push far behind in readiness to wave
-PRON- order to the helmsman cast -PRON- eager glance in the direction
indicate aloft by the outstretched motionless arm of daggoo

whether the flit attendance of the one still and solitary jet have
gradually work upon ahab so that -PRON- be now prepared to connect the
idea of mildness and repose with the first sight of the particular
whale -PRON- pursue however this be or whether -PRON- eagerness betray
-PRON- whichev way -PRON- may have be no sooner do -PRON- distinctly
perceive the white mass than with a quick intensity -PRON- instantly give
order for lower

the four boat be soon on the water ahab 's in advance and all
swiftly pull towards -PRON- prey soon -PRON- go down and while with
oar suspend -PRON- be await -PRON- reappearance lo in the same
spot where -PRON- sink once more -PRON- slowly rise almost forget for
the moment all thought of moby dick -PRON- now gaze at the most wondrous
phenomenon which the secret sea have hitherto reveal to mankind
a vast pulpy mass furlong in length and breadth of a glance
cream colour lie float on the water innumerable long arm radiate
from -PRON- centre and curling and twisting like a nest of anacondas as
if blindly to clutch at any hapless object within reach no perceptible
face or front do -PRON- have no conceivable token of either sensation or
instinct but undulate there on the billow an unearthly formless
chance like apparition of life

as with a low sucking sound -PRON- slowly disappear again starbuck still
gaze at the agitated water where -PRON- have sink with a wild voice
exclaimed--"almost rather have -PRON- see moby dick and fight -PRON- than to
have see thee thou white ghost

what be -PRON- sir say flask

the great live squid which -PRON- say few whale ship ever behold and
return to -PRON- port to tell of -PRON-

but ahab say nothing turn -PRON- boat -PRON- sail back to the vessel
the rest as silently follow

whatev superstition the sperm whaleman in general have connect with
the sight of this object certain -PRON- be that a glimpse of -PRON- be
so very unusual that circumstance have go far to invest -PRON- with
portentousness so rarely be -PRON- beheld that though one and all of -PRON-
declare -PRON- to be the large animated thing in the ocean yet very few
of -PRON- have any but the most vague idea concern -PRON- true nature and
form notwithstanding -PRON- believe -PRON- to furnish to the sperm whale
-PRON- only food for though other specie of whale find -PRON- food above
water and may be see by man in the act of feeding the spermaceti
whale obtain -PRON- whole food in unknown zone below the surface and
only by inference be -PRON- that any one can tell of what precisely that
food consist at time when closely pursue -PRON- will disgorge what
be suppose to be the detached arm of the squid some of -PRON- thus
exhibit exceed twenty and thirty foot in length -PRON- fancy that
the monster to which these arm belong ordinarily cling by -PRON- to
the bed of the ocean and that the sperm whale unlike other specie be
supply with tooth in order to attack and tear -PRON-

there seem some ground to imagine that the great kraken of bishop
pontoppodan may ultimately resolve -PRON- into squid the manner in
which the bishop describe -PRON- as alternately rise and sink with
some other particular -PRON- narrate in all this the two correspond
but much abatement be necessary with respect to the incredible bulk -PRON-
assign -PRON-

by some naturalist who have vaguely hear rumor of the mysterious
creature here speak of -PRON- be include among the class of cuttle fish
to which indeed in certain external respect -PRON- would seem to belong
but only as the anak of the tribe



chapter 60 the line


with reference to the whaling scene shortly to be describe as well as
for the good understanding of all similar scene elsewhere present
-PRON- have here to speak of the magical sometimes horrible whale line

the line originally use in the fishery be of the good hemp slightly
vapour with tar not impregnate with -PRON- as in the case of ordinary
rope for while tar as ordinarily use make the hemp more pliable to
the rope maker and also render the rope -PRON- more convenient to the
sailor for common ship use yet not only would the ordinary quantity
too much stiffen the whale line for the close coiling to which -PRON- must
be subject but as most seaman be begin to learn tar in general
by no means add to the rope 's durability or strength however much -PRON-
may give -PRON- compactness and gloss

of late year the manilla rope have in the american fishery almost
entirely supersede hemp as a material for whale line for though not
so durable as hemp -PRON- be strong and far more soft and elastic and
-PRON- will add since there be an aesthetic in all thing be much more
handsome and become to the boat than hemp hemp be a dusky dark
fellow a sort of indian but manilla be as a golden haired circassian
to behold

the whale line be only two third of an inch in thickness at first
sight -PRON- would not think -PRON- so strong as -PRON- really be by experiment
-PRON- one and fifty yarn will each suspend a weight of one hundred and
twenty pound so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal
to three ton in length the common sperm whale line measure something
over two hundred fathom towards the stern of the boat -PRON- be spirally
coil away in the tub not like the worm pipe of a still though but so
as to form one round cheese shape mass of densely bed sheaf or
layer of concentric spiralization without any hollow but the heart
or minute vertical tube form at the axis of the cheese as the least
tangle or kink in the coiling would in run out infallibly take
somebody 's arm leg or entire body off the utmost precaution be use
in stow the line in -PRON- tub some harpooneer will consume almost an
entire morning in this business carry the line high aloft and then
reeve -PRON- downwards through a block towards the tub so as in the act
of coiling to free -PRON- from all possible wrinkle and twist

in the english boat two tub be use instead of one the same line
be continuously coil in both tub there be some advantage in this
because these twin tub be so small -PRON- fit more readily into the
boat and do not strain -PRON- so much whereas the american tub nearly
three foot in diameter and of proportionate depth make a rather bulky
freight for a craft whose plank be but one half inch in thickness for
the bottom of the whale boat be like critical ice which will bear up
a considerable distribute weight but not very much of a concentrated
one when the paint canvas cover be clap on the american line tub
the boat look as if -PRON- be pull off with a prodigious great
wedding cake to present to the whale

both end of the line be expose the lower end terminate in an
eye splice or loop come up from the bottom against the side of the
tub and hang over -PRON- edge completely disengage from everything
this arrangement of the lower end be necessary on two account first
in order to facilitate the fastening to -PRON- of an additional line from a
neighboring boat in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as
to threaten to carry off the entire line originally attach to the
harpoon in these instance the whale of course be shift like a mug
of ale as -PRON- be from the one boat to the other though the
first boat always hover at hand to assist -PRON- consort second this
arrangement be indispensable for common safety 's sake for be the
low end of the line in any way attach to the boat and be the
whale then to run the line out to the end almost in a single smoke
minute as -PRON- sometimes do -PRON- would not stop there for the doom
boat would infallibly be drag down after -PRON- into the profundity of
the sea and in that case no town crier would ever find -PRON- again

before lower the boat for the chase the upper end of the line be
take aft from the tub and pass round the loggerhead there be again
carry forward the entire length of the boat rest crosswise upon
the loom or handle of every man 's oar so that -PRON- jog against -PRON- wrist
in rowing and also pass between the man as -PRON- alternately sit at
the opposite gunwale to the leaded chock or groove in the extreme
point prow of the boat where a wooden pin or skewer the size of a
common quill prevent -PRON- from slip out from the chock -PRON- hang
in a slight festoon over the bow and be then pass inside the boat
again and some ten or twenty fathom call box line be coil
upon the box in the bow -PRON- continue -PRON- way to the gunwale still a
little further aft and be then attach to the short warp the rope
which be immediately connect with the harpoon but previous to that
connexion the short warp go through sundry mystification too tedious
to detail

thus the whale line fold the whole boat in -PRON- complicated coil
twisting and writhe around -PRON- in almost every direction all the
oarsman be involve in -PRON- perilous contortion so that to the timid
eye of the landsman -PRON- seem as indian juggler with the deadly
snake sportively festoon -PRON- limb nor can any son of mortal
woman for the first time seat -PRON- amid those hempen intricacy
and while strain -PRON- utmost at the oar bethink -PRON- that at any
unknown instant the harpoon may be dart and all these horrible
contortion be put in play like ring lightning -PRON- can not be thus
circumstanc without a shudder that make the very marrow in -PRON- bone
to quiver in -PRON- like a shake jelly yet habit strange thing what
can not habit accomplish gayer sally more merry mirth good joke
and bright repartee -PRON- never hear over -PRON- mahogany than -PRON-
will hear over the half inch white cedar of the whale boat when thus
hang in hangman 's noose and like the six burgher of calais before
king edward the six man compose the crew pull into the jaw of death
with a halter around every neck as -PRON- may say

perhaps a very little thought will now enable -PRON- to account for
those repeat whaling disaster some few of which be casually
chronicle of this man or that man be take out of the boat by the
line and lose for when the line be dart out to be seat then in
the boat be like be seat in the midst of the manifold whizzing
of a steam engine in full play when every flying beam and shaft and
wheel be graze -PRON- -PRON- be bad for -PRON- can not sit motionless in the
heart of these peril because the boat be rock like a cradle and
-PRON- be pitch one way and the other without the slight warning
and only by a certain self adjust buoyancy and simultaneousness of
volition and action can -PRON- escape be make a mazeppa of and run
away with where the all see sun -PRON- could never pierce -PRON- out

again as the profound calm which only apparently precede and
prophesie of the storm be perhaps more awful than the storm -PRON-
for indeed the calm be but the wrapper and envelope of the storm and
contain -PRON- in -PRON- as the seemingly harmless rifle hold the fatal
powder and the ball and the explosion so the graceful repose of the
line as -PRON- silently serpentin about the oarsmen before be bring
into actual play this be a thing which carry more of true terror than
any other aspect of this dangerous affair but why say more all man
live envelop in whale line all be bear with halter round -PRON-
neck but -PRON- be only when catch in the swift sudden turn of death
that mortal realize the silent subtle ever present peril of life
and if -PRON- be a philosopher though seat in the whale boat -PRON- would
not at heart feel one whit more of terror than though seat before
-PRON- evening fire with a poker and not a harpoon by -PRON- side



chapter 61 stubb kills a whale


if to starbuck the apparition of the squid be a thing of portent to
queequeg -PRON- be quite a different object

when -PRON- see -PRON- quid say the savage hone -PRON- harpoon in the bow
of -PRON- hoist boat then -PRON- quick see -PRON- parm whale

the next day be exceedingly still and sultry and with nothing special
to engage -PRON- the pequod 's crew could hardly resist the spell of sleep
induce by such a vacant sea for this part of the indian ocean through
which -PRON- then be voyage be not what whaleman call a lively ground
that be -PRON- afford few glimpse of porpoise dolphin fly fish
and other vivacious denizen of more stirring water than those off the
rio de la plata or the in shore ground off peru

-PRON- be -PRON- turn to stand at the foremast head and with -PRON- shoulder
lean against the slacken royal shrouds to and fro -PRON- idly sway in
what seem an enchanted air no resolution could withstand -PRON- in that
dreamy mood lose all consciousness at last -PRON- soul go out of -PRON-
body though -PRON- body still continue to sway as a pendulum will long
after the power which first move -PRON- be withdraw

ere forgetfulness altogether come over -PRON- -PRON- have notice that the seamen
at the main and mizzen mast head be already drowsy so that at last
all three of -PRON- lifelessly swing from the spar and for every swing
that -PRON- make there be a nod from below from the slumbering helmsman
the wave too nod -PRON- indolent crest and across the wide trance
of the sea east nod to west and the sun over all

suddenly bubble seem burst beneath -PRON- closed eye like vice -PRON-
hand grasp the shroud some invisible gracious agency preserve -PRON-
with a shock -PRON- come back to life and lo close under -PRON- lee not forty
fathom off a gigantic sperm whale lie roll in the water like the
capsize hull of a frigate -PRON- broad glossy back of an ethiopian hue
glisten in the sun 's ray like a mirror but lazily undulating in
the trough of the sea and ever and anon tranquilly spout -PRON- vapoury
jet the whale look like a portly burgher smoke -PRON- pipe of a warm
afternoon but that pipe poor whale be thy last as if strike by some
enchanter 's wand the sleepy ship and every sleeper in -PRON- all at once
start into wakefulness and more than a score of voice from all part
of the vessel simultaneously with the three note from aloft shout
forth the accustomed cry as the great fish slowly and regularly spout
the sparkle brine into the air

clear away the boat luff cry ahab and obey -PRON- own order -PRON-
dash the helm down before the helmsman could handle the spoke

the sudden exclamation of the crew must have alarm the whale and ere
the boat be down majestically turn -PRON- swim away to the leeward
but with such a steady tranquillity and make so few ripple as -PRON-
swam that thinking after all -PRON- may not as yet be alarm ahab give
order that not an oar should be use and no man must speak but in
whisper so seat like ontario indians on the gunwale of the boat
-PRON- swiftly but silently paddle along the calm not admit of the
noiseless sail be set presently as -PRON- thus glide in chase the
monster perpendicularly flit -PRON- tail forty foot into the air and
then sink out of sight like a tower swallow up

there go fluke be the cry an announcement immediately follow by
stubb 's produce -PRON- match and ignite -PRON- pipe for now a respite be
grant after the full interval of -PRON- sounding have elapse the whale
rise again and be now in advance of the smoker 's boat and much
nearer to -PRON- than to any of the other stubb count upon the honour
of the capture -PRON- be obvious now that the whale have at length become
aware of -PRON- pursuer all silence of cautiousness be therefore no
long of use paddle be drop and oar come loudly into play and
still puff at -PRON- pipe stubb cheer on -PRON- crew to the assault

yes a mighty change have come over the fish all alive to -PRON- jeopardy
-PRON- be go head out that part obliquely project from the mad
yeast which -PRON- brew


-PRON- will be see in some other place of what a very light substance
the entire interior of the sperm whale 's enormous head consist though
apparently the most massive -PRON- be by far the most buoyant part about
-PRON- so that with ease -PRON- elevate -PRON- in the air and invariably do
so when go at -PRON- utmost speed besides such be the breadth of the
upper part of the front of -PRON- head and such the tapering cut water
formation of the low part that by obliquely elevate -PRON- head -PRON-
thereby may be say to transform -PRON- from a bluff bow sluggish
galliot into a sharppointed new york pilot boat


start -PRON- start -PRON- -PRON- man do not hurry yourself take plenty of
time but start -PRON- start -PRON- like thunder clap that be all cry
stubb splutter out the smoke as -PRON- speak start -PRON- now give 'em
the long and strong stroke tashtego start -PRON- tash -PRON- boy start
-PRON- all but keep cool keep cool cucumber be the word easy
easy only start -PRON- like grim death and grin devil and raise the
bury dead perpendicular out of -PRON- graf boy that be all start
-PRON-

woo hoo wa hee scream the gay header in reply raise some
old war whoop to the sky as every oarsman in the strained boat
involuntarily bounce forward with the one tremendous lead stroke
which the eager indian give

but -PRON- wild scream be answer by other quite as wild kee hee
kee hee yell daggoo strain forward and backward on -PRON- seat
like a pacing tiger in -PRON- cage

ka la koo loo howl queequeg as if smack -PRON- lip over a
mouthful of grenadier 's steak and thus with oar and yell the keel
cut the sea meanwhile stubb retain -PRON- place in the van still
encourage -PRON- man to the onset all the while puff the smoke from
-PRON- mouth like desperado -PRON- tug and -PRON- strain till the
welcome cry be heard--"stand up tashtego!--give -PRON- to -PRON- the
harpoon be hurl stern all the oarsman back water the same
moment something go hot and hissing along every one of -PRON- wrist
-PRON- be the magical line an instant before stubb have swiftly catch two
additional turn with -PRON- round the loggerhead whence by reason of -PRON-
increase rapid circling a hempen blue smoke now jet up and mingle
with the steady fume from -PRON- pipe as the line pass round and
round the loggerhead so also just before reach that point -PRON-
blisteringly pass through and through both of stubb 's hand from
which the hand cloth or square of quilt canvas sometimes wear at
these time have accidentally drop -PRON- be like hold an enemy 's
sharp two edged sword by the blade and that enemy all the time strive
to wrest -PRON- out of -PRON- clutch

wet the line wet the line cry stubb to the tub oarsman -PRON- seat
by the tub who snatch off -PRON- hat dash sea water into -PRON- more
turn be take so that the line begin hold -PRON- place the boat now
fly through the boiling water like a shark all fin stubb and tashtego
here change place stem for stern a staggering business truly in that
rock commotion


partly to show the indispensableness of this act -PRON- may here be
state that in the old dutch fishery a mop be use to dash the
run line with water in many other ship a wooden piggin or
bailer be set apart for that purpose -PRON- hat however be the most
convenient


from the vibrate line extend the entire length of the upper part of
the boat and from -PRON- now be more tight than a harpstring -PRON- would
have think the craft have two keel one cleave the water the other
the air as the boat churn on through both oppose element at once
a continual cascade play at the bow a ceaseless whirl eddy in
-PRON- wake and at the slight motion from within even but of a little
finger the vibrating crack craft cant over -PRON- spasmodic gunwale
into the sea thus -PRON- rush each man with might and main cling
to -PRON- seat to prevent be toss to the foam and the tall form of
tashtego at the steer oar crouch almost double in order to bring
down -PRON- centre of gravity whole atlantics and pacifics seem pass
as -PRON- shoot on -PRON- way till at length the whale somewhat slacken
-PRON- flight

haul in haul in cry stubb to the bowsman and face round
towards the whale all hand begin pull the boat up to -PRON- while yet
the boat be be tow on soon range up by -PRON- flank stubb firmly
plant -PRON- knee in the clumsy cleat dart dart after dart into the
fly fish at the word of command the boat alternately stern
out of the way of the whale 's horrible wallow and then range up for
another fling

the red tide now pour from all side of the monster like brook down a
hill -PRON- torment body roll not in brine but in blood which bubble
and seethe for furlong behind in -PRON- wake the slant sun play
upon this crimson pond in the sea send back -PRON- reflection into every
face so that -PRON- all glow to each other like red man and all
the while jet after jet of white smoke be agonizingly shoot from the
spiracle of the whale and vehement puff after puff from the mouth of
the excited headsman as at every dart haul in upon -PRON- crooked
lance by the line attach to -PRON- stubb straighten -PRON- again and
again by a few rapid blow against the gunwale then again and again
send -PRON- into the whale

pull up pull up -PRON- now cry to the bowsman as the waning whale
relaxed in -PRON- wrath pull up!--close to and the boat range along
the fish 's flank when reach far over the bow stubb slowly churn
-PRON- long sharp lance into the fish and keep -PRON- there carefully
churn and churn as if cautiously seek to feel after some gold
watch that the whale may have swallow and which -PRON- be fearful of
break ere -PRON- could hook -PRON- out but that gold watch -PRON- seek be the
innermost life of the fish and now -PRON- be strike for start from
-PRON- trance into that unspeakable thing call -PRON- flurry the monster
horribly wallow in -PRON- blood overwrapp -PRON- in impenetrable
mad boil spray so that the imperill craft instantly drop
astern have much ado blindly to struggle out from that phrensi
twilight into the clear air of the day

and now abate in -PRON- flurry the whale once more roll out into view
surge from side to side spasmodically dilate and contract -PRON-
spout hole with sharp crack agonize respiration at last gush
after gush of clotted red gore as if -PRON- have be the purple lee of red
wine shoot into the frighted air and fall back again run drip
down -PRON- motionless flank into the sea -PRON- heart have burst

-PRON- be dead mr. stubb say daggoo

yes both pipe smoke out and withdraw -PRON- own from -PRON- mouth
stubb scatter the dead ash over the water and for a moment stand
thoughtfully eye the vast corpse -PRON- have make



chapter 62 the dart


a word concern an incident in the last chapter

accord to the invariable usage of the fishery the whale boat push
off from the ship with the headsman or whale killer as temporary
steersman and the harpooneer or whale fastener pull the foremost
oar the one know as the harpooneer oar now -PRON- need a strong nervous
arm to strike the first iron into the fish for often in what be call
a long dart the heavy implement have to be flung to the distance of
twenty or thirty foot but however prolonged and exhaust the chase
the harpooneer be expect to pull -PRON- oar meanwhile to the uttermost
indeed -PRON- be expect to set an example of superhuman activity to the
rest not only by incredible rowing but by repeat loud and intrepid
exclamation and what -PRON- be to keep shout at the top of one 's
compass while all the other muscle be strain and half start what
that be none know but those who have try -PRON- for one -PRON- can not bawl
very heartily and work very recklessly at one and the same time in this
strain bawl state then with -PRON- back to the fish all at once
the exhausted harpooneer hear the exciting cry--"stand up and give -PRON-
to -PRON- -PRON- now have to drop and secure -PRON- oar turn round on -PRON-
centre half way seize -PRON- harpoon from the crotch and with what little
strength may remain -PRON- essay to pitch -PRON- somehow into the whale no
wonder take the whole fleet of whaleman in a body that out of fifty
fair chance for a dart not five be successful no wonder that so many
hapless harpooneer be madly curse and disrat no wonder that some
of -PRON- actually burst -PRON- blood vessel in the boat no wonder that
some sperm whaleman be absent four year with four barrel no wonder
that to many ship owner whaling be but a losing concern for -PRON- be the
harpooneer that make the voyage and if -PRON- take the breath out of -PRON-
body how can -PRON- expect to find -PRON- there when most want

again if the dart be successful then at the second critical instant
that be when the whale start to run the boatheader and harpooneer
likewise start to run fore and aft to the imminent jeopardy of
-PRON- and every one else -PRON- be then -PRON- change place and
the headsman the chief officer of the little craft take -PRON- proper
station in the bow of the boat

now -PRON- care not who maintain the contrary but all this be both foolish
and unnecessary the headsman should stay in the bow from first to
last -PRON- should both dart the harpoon and the lance and no rowing
whatev should be expect of -PRON- except under circumstance obvious
to any fisherman -PRON- know that this would sometimes involve a slight loss
of speed in the chase but long experience in various whaleman of more
than one nation have convince -PRON- that in the vast majority of failure
in the fishery -PRON- have not by any mean be so much the speed of the
whale as the before describe exhaustion of the harpooneer that have
cause -PRON-

to insure the great efficiency in the dart the harpooneer of this
world must start to -PRON- foot from out of idleness and not from out of
toil



chapter 63 the crotch


out of the trunk the branch grow out of -PRON- the twig so in
productive subject grow the chapter

the crotch allude to on a previous page deserve independent mention
-PRON- be a notched stick of a peculiar form some two foot in length which
be perpendicularly insert into the starboard gunwale near the bow
for the purpose of furnish a rest for the wooden extremity of the
harpoon whose other naked barbed end slopingly project from the prow
thereby the weapon be instantly at hand to -PRON- hurler who snatch -PRON-
up as readily from -PRON- rest as a backwoodsman swing -PRON- rifle from
the wall -PRON- be customary to have two harpoon repose in the crotch
respectively call the first and second iron

but these two harpoon each by -PRON- own cord be both connect with
the line the object be this to dart -PRON- both if possible one
instantly after the other into the same whale so that if in the come
drag one should draw out the other may still retain a hold -PRON- be a
doubling of the chance but -PRON- very often happen that owe to the
instantaneous violent convulsive running of the whale upon receive
the first iron -PRON- become impossible for the harpooneer however
lightning like in -PRON- movement to pitch the second iron into -PRON-
nevertheless as the second iron be already connect with the line
and the line be run hence that weapon must at all event be
anticipatingly toss out of the boat somehow and somewhere else the
most terrible jeopardy would involve all hand tumble into the water
-PRON- accordingly be in such case the spare coil of box line mention
in a precede chapter make this feat in most instance prudently
practicable but this critical act be not always unattended with the
sad and most fatal casualty

furthermore -PRON- must know that when the second iron be throw
overboard -PRON- thenceforth become a dangling sharp edge terror
skittishly curvet about both boat and whale entangle the line
or cut -PRON- and make a prodigious sensation in all direction
nor in general be -PRON- possible to secure -PRON- again until the whale be
fairly capture and a corpse

consider now how -PRON- must be in the case of four boat all engage
one unusually strong active and know whale when owe to these
quality in -PRON- as well as to the thousand concur accident of
such an audacious enterprise eight or ten loose second iron may be
simultaneously dangle about -PRON- for of course each boat be supply
with several harpoon to bend on to the line should the first one
be ineffectually dart without recovery all these particular be
faithfully narrate here as -PRON- will not fail to elucidate several
most important however intricate passage in scene hereafter to be
paint



chapter 64 stubb 's supper


stubb 's whale have be kill some distance from the ship -PRON- be
a calm so form a tandem of three boat -PRON- commence the slow
business of tow the trophy to the pequod and now as -PRON- eighteen man
with -PRON- thirty six arm and one hundred and eighty thumb and finger
slowly toil hour after hour upon that inert sluggish corpse in the
sea and -PRON- seem hardly to budge at all except at long interval
good evidence be hereby furnish of the enormousness of the mass -PRON-
move for upon the great canal of hang ho or whatev -PRON- call
-PRON- in china four or five laborer on the foot path will draw a bulky
freight junk at the rate of a mile an hour but this grand argosy -PRON-
tow heavily forge along as if lade with pig lead in bulk

darkness come on but three light up and down in the pequod 's
main rig dimly guide -PRON- way till draw nearer -PRON- see ahab
drop one of several more lantern over the bulwark vacantly eye
the heave whale for a moment -PRON- issue the usual order for secure
-PRON- for the night and then hand -PRON- lantern to a seaman go -PRON- way
into the cabin and do not come forward again until morning

though in oversee the pursuit of this whale captain ahab have
evince -PRON- customary activity to call -PRON- so yet now that the creature
be dead some vague dissatisfaction or impatience or despair seem
work in -PRON- as if the sight of that dead body remind -PRON- that
moby dick be yet to be slay and though a thousand other whale be
bring to -PRON- ship all that would not one jot advance -PRON- grand
monomaniac object very soon -PRON- would have think from the sound on
the pequod 's deck that all hand be prepare to cast anchor in
the deep for heavy chain be be drag along the deck and thrust
rattle out of the port hole but by those clank link the vast
corpse -PRON- not the ship be to be moor tie by the head to the
stern and by the tail to the bow the whale now lie with -PRON- black
hull close to the vessel 's and see through the darkness of the night
which obscure the spar and rig aloft the two ship and whale
seem yoke together like colossal bullock whereof one recline while
the other remain standing


a little item may as well be relate here the strong and most
reliable hold which the ship have upon the whale when moor alongside
be by the fluke or tail and as from -PRON- great density that part
be relatively heavy than any other except the side fin -PRON-
flexibility even in death cause -PRON- to sink low beneath the surface so
that with the hand -PRON- can not get at -PRON- from the boat in order to
put the chain round -PRON- but this difficulty be ingeniously overcome a
small strong line be prepare with a wooden float at -PRON- outer end and
a weight in -PRON- middle while the other end be secure to the ship by
adroit management the wooden float be make to rise on the other side
of the mass so that now have girdle the whale the chain be readily
make to follow suit and be slip along the body be at last lock
fast round the small part of the tail at the point of junction with
-PRON- broad fluke or lobe


if moody ahab be now all quiescence at least so far as could be know
on deck stubb -PRON- second mate flush with conquest betray an
unusual but still good natured excitement such an unwonted bustle be
-PRON- in that the staid starbuck -PRON- official superior quietly resign
to -PRON- for the time the sole management of affair one small help
cause of all this liveliness in stubb be soon make strangely manifest
stubb be a high liver -PRON- be somewhat intemperately fond of the whale
as a flavorish thing to -PRON- palate

a steak a steak ere -PRON- sleep -PRON- daggoo overboard -PRON- go and cut
-PRON- one from -PRON- small

here be -PRON- know that though these wild fisherman do not as a general
thing and accord to the great military maxim make the enemy defray
the current expense of the war at least before realize the proceed
of the voyage yet now and then -PRON- find some of these nantucketer
who have a genuine relish for that particular part of the sperm whale
designate by stubb comprise the tapering extremity of the body

about midnight that steak be cut and cook and light by two
lantern of sperm oil stubb stoutly stand up to -PRON- spermaceti supper
at the capstan head as if that capstan be a sideboard nor be stubb
the only banqueter on whale 's flesh that night mingle -PRON- mumbling
with -PRON- own mastication thousand on thousand of shark swarm
round the dead leviathan smackingly feast on -PRON- fatness the few
sleeper below in -PRON- bunk be often startle by the sharp slapping
of -PRON- tail against the hull within a few inch of the sleeper
heart peer over the side -PRON- could just see -PRON- as before -PRON-
hear -PRON- wallow in the sullen black water and turn over on
-PRON- back as -PRON- scoop out huge globular piece of the whale of the
bigness of a human head this particular feat of the shark seem all
but miraculous how at such an apparently unassailable surface -PRON-
contrive to gouge out such symmetrical mouthfuls remain a part of the
universal problem of all thing the mark -PRON- thus leave on the whale
may good be liken to the hollow make by a carpenter in countersink
for a screw

though amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea fight shark
will be see longingly gaze up to the ship 's deck like hungry dog
round a table where red meat be be carve ready to bolt down
every kill man that be toss to -PRON- and though while the valiant
butcher over the deck table be thus cannibally carve each other 's
live meat with carve knife all gilded and tassel the shark
also with -PRON- jewel hilt mouth be quarrelsomely carve away
under the table at the dead meat and though be -PRON- to turn the whole
affair upside down -PRON- would still be pretty much the same thing that
be to say a shocking sharkish business enough for all party and
though shark also be the invariable outrider of all slave ship
cross the atlantic systematically trot alongside to be handy in
case a parcel be to be carry anywhere or a dead slave to be decently
bury and though one or two other like instance may be set down
touch the set term place and occasion when shark do most
socially congregate and most hilariously feast yet be there no
conceivable time or occasion when -PRON- will find -PRON- in such countless
number and in gayer or more jovial spirit than around a dead sperm
whale moor by night to a whaleship at sea if -PRON- have never
see that sight then suspend -PRON- decision about the propriety of
devil worship and the expediency of conciliate the devil

but as yet stubb heed not the mumbling of the banquet that be
go on so nigh -PRON- no more than the shark heed the smacking of -PRON-
own epicurean lip

cook cook!--where be that old fleece -PRON- cry at length widen
-PRON- leg still further as if to form a more secure base for -PRON- supper
and at the same time dart -PRON- fork into the dish as if stab
with -PRON- lance cook -PRON- cook!--sail this way cook

the old black not in any very high glee at have be previously
rouse from -PRON- warm hammock at a most unseasonable hour come shamble
along from -PRON- galley for like many old black there be something
the matter with -PRON- knee pan which -PRON- do not keep well scour like
-PRON- other pan this old fleece as -PRON- call -PRON- come shuffling and
limp along assist -PRON- step with -PRON- tong which after a clumsy
fashion be make of straighten iron hoop this old ebony flounder
along and in obedience to the word of command come to a dead stop on
the opposite side of stubb 's sideboard when with both hand fold
before -PRON- and rest on -PRON- two legged cane -PRON- bow -PRON- arch back
still further over at the same time sideway incline -PRON- head so as
to bring -PRON- good ear into play

cook say stubb rapidly lift a rather reddish morsel to -PRON-
mouth do n't -PRON- think this steak be rather overdone -PRON- have be
beat this steak too much cook -PRON- be too tender do not -PRON- always say
that to be good a whale steak must be tough there be those shark
now over the side do not -PRON- see -PRON- prefer -PRON- tough and rare what a

chapter 65 the whale as a dish


that mortal man should feed upon the creature that feed -PRON- lamp and
like stubb eat -PRON- by -PRON- own light as -PRON- may say this seem so
outlandish a thing that one must need go a little into the history and
philosophy of -PRON-

-PRON- be upon record that three century ago the tongue of the right
whale be esteem a great delicacy in france and command large
price there also that in henry viiith 's time a certain cook of the
court obtain a handsome reward for invent an admirable sauce to be
eat with barbacued porpoise which -PRON- remember be a specie of
whale porpoise indeed be to this day consider fine eating the
meat be make into ball about the size of billiard ball and be well
season and spice may be take for turtle ball or veal ball
the old monk of dunfermline be very fond of -PRON- -PRON- have a great
porpoise grant from the crown

the fact be that among -PRON- hunter at least the whale would by all
hand be consider a noble dish be there not so much of -PRON- but
when -PRON- come to sit down before a meat pie nearly one hundred foot
long -PRON- take away -PRON- appetite only the most unprejudiced of man
like stubb nowadays partake of cooked whale but the esquimaux be not
so fastidious -PRON- all know how -PRON- live upon whale and have rare
old vintage of prime old train oil zogranda one of -PRON- most famous
doctor recommend strip of blubber for infant as be exceedingly
juicy and nourishing and this remind -PRON- that certain englishman who
long ago be accidentally leave in greenland by a whaling vessel that
these man actually live for several month on the mouldy scrap of
whale which have be leave ashore after try out the blubber among
the dutch whalemen these scrap be call fritter which indeed
-PRON- greatly resemble be brown and crisp and smell something
like old amsterdam housewife dough nut or oly cook when fresh -PRON-
have such an eatable look that the most self deny stranger can hardly
keep -PRON- hand off

but what further depreciate the whale as a civilized dish be -PRON-
exceed richness -PRON- be the great prize ox of the sea too fat to be
delicately good look at -PRON- hump which would be as fine eating as
the buffalo 's which be esteem a rare dish be -PRON- not such a solid
pyramid of fat but the spermaceti -PRON- how bland and creamy that
be like the transparent half jellied white meat of a cocoanut in the
third month of -PRON- growth yet far too rich to supply a substitute for
butter nevertheless many whaleman have a method of absorb -PRON- into
some other substance and then partake of -PRON- in the long try
watch of the night -PRON- be a common thing for the seaman to dip -PRON-
ship biscuit into the huge oil pot and let -PRON- fry there awhile many
a good supper have -PRON- thus make

in the case of a small sperm whale the brain be account a fine dish
the casket of the skull be break into with an axe and the two plump
whitish lobe be withdraw precisely resemble two large pudding
-PRON- be then mix with flour and cook into a most delectable mess
in flavor somewhat resemble calf head which be quite a dish among
some epicure and every one know that some young buck among the
epicure by continually din upon calf brain by and by get to
have a little brain of -PRON- own so as to be able to tell a
calf 's head from -PRON- own head which indeed require uncommon
discrimination and that be the reason why a young buck with an
intelligent look calf 's head before -PRON- be somehow one of the
sad sight -PRON- can see the head look a sort of reproachfully at
-PRON- with an et tu brute expression

-PRON- be not perhaps entirely because the whale be so excessively
unctuous that landsman seem to regard the eating of -PRON- with abhorrence
that appear to result in some way from the consideration before
mention i.e. that a man should eat a newly murder thing of the sea
and eat -PRON- too by -PRON- own light but no doubt the first man that ever
murder an ox be regard as a murderer perhaps -PRON- be hang and if
-PRON- have be put on -PRON- trial by oxen -PRON- certainly would have be and
-PRON- certainly deserve -PRON- if any murderer do go to the meat market
of a saturday night and see the crowd of live biped star up at the
long row of dead quadruped do not that sight take a tooth out of
the cannibal 's jaw cannibal who be not a cannibal -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- will
be more tolerable for the fejee that salt down a lean missionary in
-PRON- cellar against a come famine -PRON- will be more tolerable for that
provident fejee -PRON- say in the day of judgment than for thee civilized
and enlightened gourmand who nailest goose to the ground and feastest
on -PRON- bloated liver in thy pate de foie gras

but stubb -PRON- eat the whale by -PRON- own light do -PRON- and that be
add insult to injury be -PRON- look at -PRON- knife handle there -PRON-
civilized and enlightened gourmand dining off that roast beef what be
that handle make of what but the bone of the brother of the very ox
-PRON- be eat and what do -PRON- pick -PRON- tooth with after devour
that fat goose with a feather of the same fowl and with what quill do
the secretary of the society for the suppression of cruelty to ganders
formally indite -PRON- circular -PRON- be only within the last month or two
that that society pass a resolution to patronise nothing but steel
pen



chapter 66 the shark massacre


when in the southern fishery a capture sperm whale after long and
weary toil be bring alongside late at night -PRON- be not as a general
thing at least customary to proceed at once to the business of cut
-PRON- in for that business be an exceedingly laborious one be not very
soon complete and require all hand to set about -PRON- therefore the
common usage be to take in all sail lash the helm a'lee and then send
every one below to -PRON- hammock till daylight with the reservation that
until that time anchor watch shall be keep that be two and two for
an hour each couple the crew in rotation shall mount the deck to see
that all go well

but sometimes especially upon the line in the pacific this plan will
not answer at all because such incalculable host of shark gather
round the moored carcase that be -PRON- leave so for six hour say on a
stretch little more than the skeleton would be visible by morning
in most other part of the ocean however where these fish do not so
largely abound -PRON- wondrous voracity can be at time considerably
diminish by vigorously stir -PRON- up with sharp whaling spade
a procedure notwithstanding which in some instance only seem to
tickle -PRON- into still great activity but -PRON- be not thus in the
present case with the pequod 's shark though to be sure any man
unaccustomed to such sight to have look over -PRON- side that night
would have almost think the whole round sea be one huge cheese and
those shark the maggot in -PRON-

nevertheless upon stubb set the anchor watch after -PRON- supper be
conclude and when accordingly queequeg and a forecastle seaman
come on deck no small excitement be create among the shark for
immediately suspend the cutting stage over the side and lower
three lantern so that -PRON- cast long gleam of light over the turbid
sea these two mariner dart -PRON- long whaling spade keep up an
incessant murdering of the shark by strike the keen steel deep
into -PRON- skull seemingly -PRON- only vital part but in the foamy
confusion of -PRON- mixed and struggle host the marksmen could not
always hit -PRON- mark and this bring about new revelation of the
incredible ferocity of the foe -PRON- viciously snap not only at each
other 's disembowelment but like flexible bow bent round and bit
-PRON- own till those entrail seem swallow over and over again by
the same mouth to be oppositely void by the gap wound nor be
this all -PRON- be unsafe to meddle with the corps and ghost of these
creature a sort of generic or pantheistic vitality seem to lurk in
-PRON- very joint and bone after what may be call the individual
life have depart kill and hoist on deck for the sake of -PRON- skin
one of these shark almost take poor queequeg 's hand off when -PRON- try
to shut down the dead lid of -PRON- murderous jaw


the whaling spade use for cut in be make of the very good steel
be about the bigness of a man 's spread hand and in general shape
correspond to the garden implement after which -PRON- be name only -PRON-
side be perfectly flat and -PRON- upper end considerably narrow than
the low this weapon be always keep as sharp as possible and when
be use be occasionally hone just like a razor in -PRON- socket a
stiff pole from twenty to thirty foot long be insert for a handle


queequeg no care what god make -PRON- shark say the savage agonizingly
lift -PRON- hand up and down wedder fejee god or nantucket god but de
god wat make shark must be one dam ingin



chapter 67 cut in


-PRON- be a saturday night and such a sabbath as follow ex officio
professor of sabbath breaking be all whaleman the ivory pequod be
turn into what seem a shamble every sailor a butcher -PRON- would
have think -PRON- be offer up ten thousand red oxen to the sea god

in the first place the enormous cutting tackle among other ponderous
thing comprise a cluster of block generally paint green and which
no single man can possibly lift this vast bunch of grape be sway up
to the main top and firmly lash to the low mast head the strong
point anywhere above a ship 's deck the end of the hawser like rope
wind through these intricacy be then conduct to the windlass
and the huge low block of the tackle be swing over the whale to
this block the great blubber hook weigh some one hundred pound be
attach and now suspend in stage over the side starbuck and stubb
the mate armed with -PRON- long spade begin cut a hole in the
body for the insertion of the hook just above the near of the two
side fin this do a broad semicircular line be cut round the hole
the hook be insert and the main body of the crew strike up a wild
chorus now commence heave in one dense crowd at the windlass when
instantly the entire ship careen over on -PRON- side every bolt in
-PRON- start like the nail head of an old house in frosty weather -PRON-
tremble quiver and nod -PRON- frighted mast head to the sky more
and more -PRON- lean over to the whale while every gasp heave of the
windlass be answer by a help heave from the billow till at last
a swift startling snap be hear with a great swash the ship roll
upwards and backwards from the whale and the triumphant tackle rise
into sight dragging after -PRON- the disengage semicircular end of the
first strip of blubber now as the blubber envelope the whale precisely
as the rind do an orange so be -PRON- strip off from the body
precisely as an orange be sometimes strip by spiraliz -PRON- for the
strain constantly keep up by the windlass continually keep the whale
roll over and over in the water and as the blubber in one strip
uniformly peel off along the line call the scarf simultaneously
cut by the spade of starbuck and stubb the mate and just as fast as
-PRON- be thus peel off and indeed by that very act -PRON- -PRON- be all the
time be hoist higher and high aloft till -PRON- upper end graze the
main top the man at the windlass then cease heave and for a moment
or two the prodigious blood drip mass sway to and fro as if let
down from the sky and every one present must take good heed to dodge
-PRON- when -PRON- swing else -PRON- may box -PRON- ear and pitch -PRON- headlong
overboard

one of the attend harpooneer now advance with a long keen weapon
call a boarding sword and watch -PRON- chance -PRON- dexterously slice
out a considerable hole in the low part of the sway mass into this
hole the end of the second alternate great tackle be then hook
so as to retain a hold upon the blubber in order to prepare for what
follow whereupon this accomplish swordsman warn all hand to
stand off once more make a scientific dash at the mass and with a few
sidelong desperate lunge slicing sever -PRON- completely in twain
so that while the short low part be still fast the long upper strip
call a blanket piece swing clear and be all ready for lower
the heaver forward now resume -PRON- song and while the one tackle be
peel and hoist a second strip from the whale the other be slowly
slacken away and down go the first strip through the main hatchway
right beneath into an unfurnished parlor call the blubber room into
this twilight apartment sundry nimble hand keep coil away the long
blanket piece as if -PRON- be a great live mass of plaited serpent
and thus the work proceed the two tackle hoist and lower
simultaneously both whale and windlass heaving the heaver singing
the blubber room gentleman coil the mate scarf the ship
strain and all hand swear occasionally by way of assuage the
general friction



chapter 68 the blanket


-PRON- have give no small attention to that not unvexed subject the skin of
the whale -PRON- have have controversy about -PRON- with experienced whaleman
afloat and learn naturalist ashore -PRON- original opinion remain
unchanged but -PRON- be only an opinion

the question be what and where be the skin of the whale already -PRON-
know what -PRON- blubber be that blubber be something of the consistence
of firm close grain beef but tough more elastic and compact and
range from eight or ten to twelve and fifteen inch in thickness

now however preposterous -PRON- may at first seem to talk of any creature 's
skin as being of that sort of consistence and thickness yet in point
of fact these be no argument against such a presumption because -PRON-
can not raise any other dense envelop layer from the whale 's body but
that same blubber and the outermost envelop layer of any animal if
reasonably dense what can that be but the skin true from the unmarred
dead body of the whale -PRON- may scrape off with -PRON- hand an infinitely
thin transparent substance somewhat resemble the thin shred
of isinglass only -PRON- be almost as flexible and soft as satin that is
previous to be dry when -PRON- not only contract and thicken but
become rather hard and brittle -PRON- have several such dry bit which
-PRON- use for mark in -PRON- whale book -PRON- be transparent as -PRON- say before
and be lay upon the print page -PRON- have sometimes please -PRON-
with fancy -PRON- exert a magnifying influence at any rate -PRON- be
pleasant to read about whale through -PRON- own spectacle as -PRON- may
say but what -PRON- be drive at here be this that same infinitely thin
isinglass substance which -PRON- admit invest the entire body of the
whale be not so much to be regard as the skin of the creature as
the skin of the skin so to speak for -PRON- be simply ridiculous to say
that the proper skin of the tremendous whale be thin and more tender
than the skin of a new bear child but no more of this

assume the blubber to be the skin of the whale then when this skin
as in the case of a very large sperm whale will yield the bulk of one
hundred barrel of oil and when -PRON- be consider that in quantity or
rather weight that oil in -PRON- express state be only three fourth
and not the entire substance of the coat some idea may hence be have
of the enormousness of that animate mass a mere part of whose mere
integument yield such a lake of liquid as that reckon ten barrel
to the ton -PRON- have ten ton for the net weight of only three quarter
of the stuff of the whale 's skin

in life the visible surface of the sperm whale be not the least among
the many marvel -PRON- present almost invariably -PRON- be all over obliquely
cross and re cross with numberless straight mark in thick array
something like those in the fine italian line engraving but these
mark do not seem to be impress upon the isinglass substance above
mention but seem to be see through -PRON- as if -PRON- be engrave
upon the body -PRON- nor be this all in some instance to the quick
observant eye those linear mark as in a veritable engraving but
afford the ground for far other delineation these be hieroglyphical
that be if -PRON- call those mysterious cypher on the wall of pyramid
hieroglyphic then that be the proper word to use in the present
connexion by -PRON- retentive memory of the hieroglyphic upon one sperm
whale in particular -PRON- be much strike with a plate represent the old
indian character chisel on the famous hieroglyphic palisade on
the bank of the upper mississippi like those mystic rock too the
mystic mark whale remain undecipherable this allusion to the indian
rock remind -PRON- of another thing besides all the other phenomena which
the exterior of the sperm whale present -PRON- not seldom display the
back and more especially -PRON- flanks efface in great part of the
regular linear appearance by reason of numerous rude scratch
altogether of an irregular random aspect -PRON- should say that those new
england rock on the sea coast which agassiz imagine to bear the mark
of violent scraping contact with vast floating icebergs -PRON- should say
that those rock must not a little resemble the sperm whale in this
particular -PRON- also seem to -PRON- that such scratch in the whale be
probably make by hostile contact with other whale for -PRON- have most
remark -PRON- in the large full grown bull of the specie

a word or two more concern this matter of the skin or blubber of
the whale -PRON- have already be say that -PRON- be stript from -PRON- in long
piece call blanket piece like most sea term this one be very
happy and significant for the whale be indeed wrapt up in -PRON- blubber
as in a real blanket or counterpane or still good an indian poncho
slipt over -PRON- head and skirt -PRON- extremity -PRON- be by reason of this
cosy blanketing of -PRON- body that the whale be enable to keep -PRON-
comfortable in all weather in all sea time and tide what would
become of a greenland whale say in those shuddering icy sea of the
north if unsuppli with -PRON- cosy surtout true other fish be
find exceedingly brisk in those hyperborean water but these be -PRON-
observe be -PRON- cold blooded lungless fish whose very belly
be refrigerator creature that warm -PRON- under the lee of
an iceberg as a traveller in winter would bask before an inn fire
whereas like man the whale have lung and warm blood freeze -PRON- blood
and -PRON- die how wonderful be -PRON- then except after explanation that
this great monster to whom corporeal warmth be as indispensable as -PRON-
be to man how wonderful that -PRON- should be find at home immerse
to -PRON- lip for life in those arctic water where when seaman fall
overboard -PRON- be sometimes find month afterwards perpendicularly
freeze into the heart of field of ice as a fly be find glue
in amber but more surprising be -PRON- to know as have be prove by
experiment that the blood of a polar whale be warm than that of a
borneo negro in summer

-PRON- do seem to -PRON- that herein -PRON- see the rare virtue of a strong
individual vitality and the rare virtue of thick wall and the rare
virtue of interior spaciousness oh man admire and model thyself after
the whale do thou too remain warm among ice do thou too live in
this world without be of -PRON- be cool at the equator keep thy blood
fluid at the pole like the great dome of st. peter 's and like the
great whale retain o man in all season a temperature of thine own

but how easy and how hopeless to teach these fine thing of erection
how few be domed like st. peter 's of creature how few vast as the
whale



chapter 69 the funeral


haul in the chain let the carcase go astern

the vast tackle have now do -PRON- duty the peel white body of the
behead whale flash like a marble sepulchre though change in hue
-PRON- have not perceptibly lose anything in bulk -PRON- be still colossal
slowly -PRON- float more and more away the water round -PRON- tear and
splash by the insatiate shark and the air above vex with rapacious
flight of scream fowl whose beak be like so many insult
poniard in the whale the vast white headless phantom float further
and further from the ship and every rod that -PRON- so float what seem
square rood of shark and cubic rood of fowl augment the murderous
din for hour and hour from the almost stationary ship that hideous
sight be see beneath the unclouded and mild azure sky upon the fair
face of the pleasant sea waft by the joyous breeze that great mass
of death float on and on till lose in infinite perspective

there be a most doleful and most mocking funeral the sea vulture all in
pious mourning the air shark all punctiliously in black or speckled
in life but few of -PRON- would have help the whale -PRON- ween if
peradventure -PRON- have need -PRON- but upon the banquet of -PRON- funeral -PRON-
most piously do pounce oh horrible vultureism of earth from which not
the mighty whale be free

nor be this the end desecrate as the body be a vengeful ghost
survif and hover over -PRON- to scare espy by some timid man of war or
blunder discovery vessel from afar when the distance obscure the
swarm fowl nevertheless still show the white mass float in
the sun and the white spray heave high against -PRON- straightway the
whale 's unharming corpse with trembling finger be set down in the
log shoals rocks and breaker hereabouts beware and for year
afterwards perhaps ship shun the place leap over -PRON- as silly
sheep leap over a vacuum because -PRON- leader originally leap there
when a stick be hold there be -PRON- law of precedent there be -PRON-
utility of tradition there be the story of -PRON- obstinate survival of
old belief never bottom on the earth and now not even hover in
the air there be orthodoxy

thus while in life the great whale 's body may have be a real terror
to -PRON- foe in -PRON- death -PRON- ghost become a powerless panic to a
world

be -PRON- a believer in ghost -PRON- friend there be other ghost than
the cock lane one and far deep man than doctor johnson who believe in
-PRON-



chapter 70 the sphynx


-PRON- should not have be omit that previous to completely strip
the body of the leviathan -PRON- be behead now the beheading of the
sperm whale be a scientific anatomical feat upon which experience
whale surgeon very much pride -PRON- and not without reason

consider that the whale have nothing that can properly be call a neck
on the contrary where -PRON- head and body seem to join there in that
very place be the thick part of -PRON- remember also that the
surgeon must operate from above some eight or ten foot intervene
between -PRON- and -PRON- subject and that subject almost hide in a
discolour roll and oftentimes tumultuous and bursting sea bear
in mind too that under these untoward circumstance -PRON- have to cut many
foot deep in the flesh and in that subterraneous manner without so
much as get one single peep into the ever contract gash thus
make -PRON- must skilfully steer clear of all adjacent interdicted part
and exactly divide the spine at a critical point hard by -PRON- insertion
into the skull do -PRON- not marvel then at stubb 's boast that -PRON-
demand but ten minute to behead a sperm whale

when first sever the head be drop astern and hold there by a cable
till the body be stripped that do if -PRON- belong to a small whale
-PRON- be hoist on deck to be deliberately dispose of but with a full
grow leviathan this be impossible for the sperm whale 's head embrace
nearly one third of -PRON- entire bulk and completely to suspend such a
burden as that even by the immense tackle of a whaler this be as
vain a thing as to attempt weigh a dutch barn in jeweller scale

the pequod 's whale be decapitate and the body strip the head be
hoist against the ship 's side about half way out of the sea so that
-PRON- may yet in great part be buoy up by -PRON- native element and there
with the strain craft steeply lean over to -PRON- by reason of the
enormous downward drag from the low mast head and every yard arm
on that side project like a crane over the wave there that
blood drip head hang to the pequod 's waist like the giant
holofernes 's from the girdle of judith

when this last task be accomplish -PRON- be noon and the seamen go
below to -PRON- dinner silence reign over the before tumultuous but
now desert deck an intense copper calm like a universal yellow
lotus be more and more unfold -PRON- noiseless measureless leave upon
the sea

a short space elapse and up into this noiselessness come ahab alone
from -PRON- cabin take a few turn on the quarter deck -PRON- pause to
gaze over the side then slowly get into the main chain -PRON-
take stubb 's long spade still remain there after the whale 's
decapitation and strike -PRON- into the low part of the half suspend
mass place -PRON- other end crutch wise under one arm and so stand
lean over with eye attentively fix on this head

-PRON- be a black and hooded head and hang there in the midst of so
intense a calm -PRON- seem the sphynx 's in the desert speak thou vast
and venerable head mutter ahab which though ungarnished with a
beard yet here and there lookest hoary with moss speak mighty head
and tell -PRON- the secret thing that be in thee of all diver thou hast
dive the deep that head upon which the upper sun now gleam have
move amid this world 's foundation where unrecorded name and navy
rust and untold hope and anchor rot where in -PRON- murderous hold this
frigate earth be ballast with bone of million of the drown there
in that awful water land there be thy most familiar home thou hast
be where bell or diver never go hast sleep by many a sailor 's side
where sleepless mother would give -PRON- life to lay -PRON- down thou
saw'st the lock lover when leap from -PRON- flaming ship heart
to heart -PRON- sink beneath the exult wave true to each other when
heaven seem false to -PRON- thou saw'st the murder mate when toss
by pirate from the midnight deck for hour -PRON- fall into the deep
midnight of the insatiate maw and -PRON- murderer still sail on
unharmed while swift lightning shiver the neighboring ship that
would have bear a righteous husband to outstretched long arm o
head thou hast see enough to split the planet and make an infidel of
abraham and not one syllable be thine

sail ho cry a triumphant voice from the main mast head

aye well now that be cheering cry ahab suddenly erect
-PRON- while whole thunder cloud sweep aside from -PRON- brow
that lively cry upon this deadly calm may almost convert a good
man where away

three point on the starboard bow sir and bring down -PRON- breeze to
-PRON-

better and good man would now st. paul would come along that way
and to -PRON- breezelessness bring -PRON- breeze o nature and o soul of man
how far beyond all utterance be -PRON- link analogy not the small
atom stir or life on matter but have -PRON- cunning duplicate in mind



chapter 71 the jeroboam 's story


hand in hand ship and breeze blow on but the breeze come faster than
the ship and soon the pequod begin to rock

by and by through the glass the stranger 's boat and man mast head
prove -PRON- a whale ship but as -PRON- be so far to windward and shoot
by apparently make a passage to some other ground the pequod could
not hope to reach -PRON- so the signal be set to see what response would
be make

here be -PRON- say that like the vessel of military marine the ship of
the american whale fleet have each a private signal all which signal
be collect in a book with the name of the respective vessel
attach every captain be provide with -PRON- thereby the whale
commander be enable to recognise each other upon the ocean even at
considerable distance and with no small facility

the pequod 's signal be at last respond to by the stranger 's set
-PRON- own which prove the ship to be the jeroboam of nantucket square
-PRON- yard -PRON- bear down range abeam under the pequod 's lee and
lower a boat -PRON- soon draw nigh but as the side ladder be be
rig by starbuck 's order to accommodate the visit captain the
stranger in question wave -PRON- hand from -PRON- boat 's stern in token
of that proceed be entirely unnecessary -PRON- turn out that
the jeroboam have a malignant epidemic on board and that mayhew -PRON-
captain be fearful of infect the pequod 's company for though
-PRON- and boat 's crew remain untainted and though -PRON- ship be half
a rifle shot off and an incorruptible sea and air rolling and flow
between yet conscientiously adhere to the timid quarantine of the
land -PRON- peremptorily refuse to come into direct contact with the
pequod

but this do by no means prevent all communication preserve an
interval of some few yard between -PRON- and the ship the jeroboam 's
boat by the occasional use of -PRON- oar contrive to keep parallel to the
pequod as -PRON- heavily forge through the sea for by this time -PRON- blow
very fresh with -PRON- main topsail aback though indeed at time by
the sudden onset of a large roll wave the boat would be push some
way ahead but would be soon skilfully bring to -PRON- proper bearing
again subject to this and other the like interruption now and then a
conversation be sustain between the two party but at interval not
without still another interruption of a very different sort

pull an oar in the jeroboam 's boat be a man of a singular
appearance even in that wild whaling life where individual notability
make up all totality -PRON- be a small short youngish man sprinkle
all over -PRON- face with freckle and wear redundant yellow hair a
long skirt cabalistically cut coat of a faded walnut tinge envelop
-PRON- the overlapping sleeve of which be roll up on -PRON- wrist a
deep settle fanatic delirium be in -PRON- eye

so soon as this figure have be first descry stubb have
exclaimed--"that be -PRON- that be he!--the long tog scaramouch the
town ho 's company tell -PRON- of stubb here allude to a strange story
tell of the jeroboam and a certain man among -PRON- crew some time
previous when the pequod speak the town ho accord to this account
and what be subsequently learn -PRON- seem that the scaramouch in
question have gain a wonderful ascendency over almost everybody in the
jeroboam -PRON- story be this

-PRON- have be originally nurture among the crazy society of neskyeuna
shaker where -PRON- have be a great prophet in -PRON- crack secret
meeting have several time descend from heaven by the way of a
trap door announce the speedy opening of the seventh vial which -PRON-
carry in -PRON- vest pocket but which instead of contain gunpowder
be suppose to be charge with laudanum a strange apostolic whim
have seize -PRON- -PRON- have leave neskyeuna for nantucket where with
that cunn peculiar to craziness -PRON- assume a steady common sense
exterior and offer -PRON- as a green hand candidate for the
jeroboam 's whaling voyage -PRON- engage -PRON- but straightway upon
the ship 's get out of sight of land -PRON- insanity break out in a
freshet -PRON- announce -PRON- as the archangel gabriel and command
the captain to jump overboard -PRON- publish -PRON- manifesto whereby
-PRON- set -PRON- forth as the deliverer of the isle of the sea and
vicar general of all oceanica the unflinching earnestness with which -PRON-
declare these thing the dark daring play of -PRON- sleepless excited
imagination and all the preternatural terror of real delirium unite
to invest this gabriel in the mind of the majority of the ignorant
crew with an atmosphere of sacredness moreover -PRON- be afraid of
-PRON- as such a man however be not of much practical use in the ship
especially as -PRON- refuse to work except when -PRON- please the incredulous
captain would fain have be rid of -PRON- but apprise that that
individual 's intention be to land -PRON- in the first convenient port the
archangel forthwith open all -PRON- seal and vial devote the ship
and all hand to unconditional perdition in case this intention be
carry out so strongly do -PRON- work upon -PRON- disciple among the crew
that at last in a body -PRON- go to the captain and tell -PRON- if gabriel
be send from the ship not a man of -PRON- would remain -PRON- be therefore
force to relinquish -PRON- plan nor would -PRON- permit gabriel to be any
way maltreated say or do what -PRON- would so that -PRON- come to pass that
gabriel have the complete freedom of the ship the consequence of all
this be that the archangel care little or nothing for the captain and
mate and since the epidemic have break out -PRON- carry a high hand
than ever declare that the plague as -PRON- call -PRON- be at -PRON- sole
command nor should -PRON- be stay but accord to -PRON- good pleasure
the sailor mostly poor devil cringe and some of -PRON- fawn before
-PRON- in obedience to -PRON- instruction sometimes render -PRON- personal
homage as to a god such thing may seem incredible but however
wondrous -PRON- be true nor be the history of fanatic half so striking
in respect to the measureless self deception of the fanatic -PRON- as
-PRON- measureless power of deceiving and bedevil so many other but
-PRON- be time to return to the pequod

-PRON- fear not thy epidemic man say ahab from the bulwark to captain
mayhew who stand in the boat 's stern come on board

but now gabriel start to -PRON- foot

think think of the fever yellow and bilious beware of the horrible
plague

gabriel gabriel cry captain mayhew thou must either-- but
that instant a headlong wave shoot the boat far ahead and -PRON- seething
drown all speech

hast thou see the white whale demand ahab when the boat drift
back

think think of thy whale boat stoven and sink beware of the horrible
tail

-PRON- tell thee again gabriel that-- but again the boat tear ahead as if
drag by fiend nothing be say for some moment while a succession
of riotous wave roll by which by one of those occasional caprice
of the sea be tumble not heave -PRON- meantime the hoist sperm
whale 's head jog about very violently and gabriel be see eye
-PRON- with rather more apprehensiveness than -PRON- archangel nature seem to
warrant

when this interlude be over captain mayhew begin a dark story
concern moby dick not however without frequent interruption from
gabriel whenever -PRON- name be mention and the crazy sea that seem
league with -PRON-

-PRON- seem that the jeroboam have not long leave home when upon speak
a whale ship -PRON- people be reliably apprise of the existence of moby
dick and the havoc -PRON- have make greedily suck in this intelligence
gabriel solemnly warn the captain against attack the white
whale in case the monster should be see in -PRON- gibber insanity
pronounce the white whale to be no less a be than the shaker god
incarnate the shakers receive the bible but when some year or two
afterwards moby dick be fairly sight from the mast head macey the
chief mate burn with ardour to encounter -PRON- and the captain -PRON-
be not unwilling to let -PRON- have the opportunity despite all
the archangel 's denunciation and forewarning macey succeed in
persuade five man to man -PRON- boat with -PRON- -PRON- push off and after
much weary pull and many perilous unsuccessful onset -PRON- at last
succeed in get one iron fast meantime gabriel ascend to
the main royal mast head be toss one arm in frantic gesture and
hurl forth prophecy of speedy doom to the sacrilegious assailant
of -PRON- divinity now while macey the mate be stand up in -PRON-
boat 's bow and with all the reckless energy of -PRON- tribe be vent
-PRON- wild exclamation upon the whale and essay to get a fair chance
for -PRON- poise lance lo a broad white shadow rise from the sea by -PRON-
quick fan motion temporarily take the breath out of the body
of the oarsman next instant the luckless mate so full of furious
life be smitten bodily into the air and make a long arc in -PRON-
descent fall into the sea at the distance of about fifty yard not a
chip of the boat be harm nor a hair of any oarsman 's head but the
mate for ever sank

-PRON- be well to parenthesize here that of the fatal accident in the
sperm whale fishery this kind be perhaps almost as frequent as any
sometimes nothing be injure but the man who be thus annihilate
oftener the boat 's bow be knock off or the thigh board in which the
headsman stand be tear from -PRON- place and accompany the body but
strange of all be the circumstance that in more instance than one
when the body have be recover not a single mark of violence be
discernible the man be stark dead

the whole calamity with the fall form of macey be plainly descry
from the ship raise a piercing shriek--"the vial the vial gabriel
call off the terror stricken crew from the further hunting of the
whale this terrible event clothe the archangel with added influence
because -PRON- credulous disciple believe that -PRON- have specifically
fore announce -PRON- instead of only make a general prophecy which any
one may have do and so have chance to hit one of many mark in the
wide margin allow -PRON- become a nameless terror to the ship

mayhew have conclude -PRON- narration ahab put such question to
-PRON- that the stranger captain could not forbear inquire whether -PRON-
intend to hunt the white whale if opportunity should offer to which
ahab answered--"aye straightway then gabriel once more start
to -PRON- foot glare upon the old man and vehemently exclaim with
downward point finger--"think think of the blasphemer dead and down
there!--beware of the blasphemer 's end

ahab stolidly turn aside then say to mayhew captain -PRON- have
just bethink -PRON- of -PRON- letter bag there be a letter for one of thy
officer if -PRON- mistake not starbuck look over the bag

every whale ship take out a goodly number of letter for various ship
whose delivery to the person to whom -PRON- may be address depend
upon the mere chance of encounter -PRON- in the four ocean thus
most letter never reach -PRON- mark and many be only receive after
attain an age of two or three year or more

soon starbuck return with a letter in -PRON- hand -PRON- be sorely tumble
damp and cover with a dull spot green mould in consequence
of be keep in a dark locker of the cabin of such a letter death
-PRON- may well have be the post boy

can'st not read -PRON- cry ahab give -PRON- -PRON- man aye aye -PRON- be but
a dim scrawl what be this as -PRON- be study -PRON- out starbuck take a
long cut spade pole and with -PRON- knife slightly split the end to
insert the letter there and in that way hand -PRON- to the boat without
-PRON- come any closer to the ship

meantime ahab hold the letter mutter mr. har yes mr.
harry--(a woman 's pinny hand the man 's wife -PRON- will wager)--aye mr
harry macey ship jeroboam why -PRON- be macey and -PRON- be dead

poor fellow poor fellow and from -PRON- wife sigh mayhew but let
-PRON- have -PRON-

nay keep -PRON- thyself cry gabriel to ahab thou art soon go that
way

curse throttle thee yell ahab captain mayhew stand by now to
receive -PRON- and take the fatal missive from starbuck 's hand -PRON-
catch -PRON- in the slit of the pole and reach -PRON- over towards the boat
but as -PRON- do so the oarsman expectantly desist from rowing the boat
drift a little towards the ship 's stern so that as if by magic the
letter suddenly range along with gabriel 's eager hand -PRON- clutch -PRON-
in an instant seize the boat knife and impale the letter on -PRON-
send -PRON- thus load back into the ship -PRON- fall at ahab 's foot then
gabriel shriek out to -PRON- comrade to give way with -PRON- oar and in
that manner the mutinous boat rapidly shoot away from the pequod

as after this interlude the seaman resume -PRON- work upon the jacket
of the whale many strange thing be hint in reference to this wild
affair



chapter 72 the monkey rope


in the tumultuous business of cut in and attend to a whale there
be much run backwards and forward among the crew now hand be
want here and then again hand be want there there be no stay
in any one place for at one and the same time everything have to be do
everywhere -PRON- be much the same with -PRON- who endeavor the description
of the scene -PRON- must now retrace -PRON- way a little -PRON- be mention
that upon first break ground in the whale 's back the blubber hook
be insert into the original hole there cut by the spade of the
mate but how do so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook
get fix in that hole -PRON- be insert there by -PRON- particular friend
queequeg whose duty -PRON- be as harpooneer to descend upon the
monster be back for the special purpose refer to but in very many
case circumstance require that the harpooneer shall remain on the
whale till the whole flensing or strip operation be conclude the
whale be -PRON- observe lie almost entirely submerge except the
immediate part operate upon so down there some ten foot below the
level of the deck the poor harpooneer flounder about half on the
whale and half in the water as the vast mass revolve like a tread mill
beneath -PRON- on the occasion in question queequeg figure in the
highland costume a shirt and sock in which to -PRON- eye at least
-PRON- appear to uncommon advantage and no one have a good chance to
observe -PRON- as will presently be see

be the savage 's bowsman that is the person who pull the bow oar
in -PRON- boat the second one from forward -PRON- be -PRON- cheerful duty to
attend upon -PRON- while take that hard scrabble scramble upon the dead
whale 's back -PRON- have see italian organ boy hold a dancing ape by
a long cord just so from the ship 's steep side do -PRON- hold queequeg
down there in the sea by what be technically call in the fishery
a monkey rope attach to a strong strip of canvas belt round -PRON-
waist

-PRON- be a humorously perilous business for both of -PRON- for before -PRON-
proceed further -PRON- must be say that the monkey rope be fast at
both end fast to queequeg 's broad canvas belt and fast to -PRON- narrow
leather one so that for good or for bad -PRON- two for the time be
wedded and should poor queequeg sink to rise no more then both usage
and honour demand that instead of cut the cord -PRON- should drag
-PRON- down in -PRON- wake so then an elongated siamese ligature unite -PRON-
queequeg be -PRON- own inseparable twin brother nor could -PRON- any way get
rid of the dangerous liability which the hempen bond entail

so strongly and metaphysically do -PRON- conceive of -PRON- situation then that
while earnestly watch -PRON- motion -PRON- seem distinctly to perceive
that -PRON- own individuality be now merge in a joint stock company of
two that -PRON- free will have receive a mortal wound and that another be
mistake or misfortune may plunge innocent -PRON- into unmerited disaster
and death therefore -PRON- see that here be a sort of interregnum in
providence for -PRON- even handed equity never could have so gross an
injustice and yet still further ponder while -PRON- jerk -PRON- now
and then from between the whale and ship which would threaten to jam
-PRON- still further ponder -PRON- say -PRON- see that this situation of -PRON-
be the precise situation of every mortal that breathe only in most
case -PRON- one way or other have this siamese connexion with a plurality
of other mortal if -PRON- banker break -PRON- snap if -PRON- apothecary by
mistake send -PRON- poison in -PRON- pill -PRON- die true -PRON- may say
that by exceed caution -PRON- may possibly escape these and the
multitudinous other evil chance of life but handle queequeg 's
monkey rope heedfully as -PRON- would sometimes -PRON- jerk -PRON- so that -PRON- come
very near slide overboard nor could -PRON- possibly forget that do what -PRON-
would -PRON- only have the management of one end of -PRON-


the monkey rope be find in all whaler but -PRON- be only in the pequod
that the monkey and -PRON- holder be ever tie together this improvement
upon the original usage be introduce by no less a man than stubb
in order to afford the imperill harpooneer the strong possible
guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of -PRON- monkey rope holder


-PRON- have hint that -PRON- would often jerk poor queequeg from between the
whale and the ship where -PRON- would occasionally fall from the incessant
roll and sway of both but this be not the only jam jeopardy
-PRON- be expose to unappall by the massacre make upon -PRON- during the
night the shark now freshly and more keenly allure by the before pent
blood which begin to flow from the carcass the rabid creature swarm
round -PRON- like bee in a beehive

and right in among those shark be queequeg who often push -PRON-
aside with -PRON- flounder foot a thing altogether incredible be
-PRON- not that attract by such prey as a dead whale the otherwise
miscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man

nevertheless -PRON- may well be believe that since -PRON- have such a
ravenous finger in the pie -PRON- be deem but wise to look sharp to -PRON-
accordingly besides the monkey rope with which -PRON- now and then jerk
the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of what seem
a peculiarly ferocious shark -PRON- be provide with still another
protection suspend over the side in one of the stage tashtego
and daggoo continually flourish over -PRON- head a couple of keen
whale spade wherewith -PRON- slaughter as many shark as -PRON- could
reach this procedure of -PRON- to be sure be very disinterested and
benevolent of -PRON- -PRON- mean queequeg 's good happiness -PRON- admit but
in -PRON- hasty zeal to befriend -PRON- and from the circumstance that both
-PRON- and the shark be at time half hide by the blood muddled water
those indiscreet spade of -PRON- would come nearer amputate a leg
than a tail but poor queequeg -PRON- suppose strain and gasp there
with that great iron hook poor queequeg -PRON- suppose only pray to -PRON-
yojo and give up -PRON- life into the hand of -PRON- god

well well -PRON- dear comrade and twin brother think -PRON- as -PRON- draw in
and then slack off the rope to every swell of the sea what matter
-PRON- after all be -PRON- not the precious image of each and all of -PRON- man
in this whaling world that unsounded ocean -PRON- gasp in be life those
shark -PRON- foe those spade -PRON- friend and what between shark
and spade -PRON- be in a sad pickle and peril poor lad

but courage there be good cheer in store for -PRON- queequeg for now as
with blue lip and blood shot eye the exhausted savage at last climb
up the chain and stand all drip and involuntarily tremble over
the side the steward advance and with a benevolent consolatory
glance hand -PRON- what some hot cognac no hand -PRON- ye god hand
-PRON- a cup of tepid ginger and water

ginger do -PRON- smell ginger suspiciously ask stubb come near
yes this must be ginger peer into the as yet untast cup then
stand as if incredulous for a while -PRON- calmly walk towards the
astonish steward slowly say ginger ginger and will -PRON- have
the goodness to tell -PRON- mr. dough boy where lie the virtue of ginger
ginger be ginger the sort of fuel -PRON- use dough boy to kindle a fire
in this shiver cannibal ginger!--what the devil be ginger
sea coal firewood lucifer match tinder gunpowder what the
devil be ginger -PRON- say that -PRON- offer this cup to -PRON- poor queequeg
here

there be some sneak temperance society movement about this
business -PRON- suddenly add now approach starbuck who have just
come from forward will -PRON- look at that kannakin sir smell of -PRON-
if -PRON- please then watch the mate 's countenance -PRON- add the
steward mr. starbuck have the face to offer that calomel and jalap
to queequeg there this instant off the whale be the steward an
apothecary sir and may -PRON- ask whether this be the sort of bitter by
which -PRON- blow back the life into a half drown man

-PRON- trust not say starbuck -PRON- be poor stuff enough

aye aye steward cry stubb -PRON- 'll teach -PRON- to drug a
harpooneer none of -PRON- apothecary 's medicine here -PRON- want to poison
-PRON- do ye -PRON- have get out insurance on -PRON- life and want to murder
-PRON- all and pocket the proceed do ye

-PRON- be not -PRON- cry dough boy -PRON- be aunt charity that bring the
ginger on board and bid -PRON- never give the harpooneer any spirit but
only this ginger jub so -PRON- call -PRON-

ginger jub -PRON- gingerly rascal take that and run along with ye
to the locker and get something good -PRON- hope -PRON- do no wrong mr.
starbuck -PRON- be the captain 's order grog for the harpooneer on a
whale

enough reply starbuck only do not hit -PRON- again but--

oh -PRON- never hurt when -PRON- hit except when -PRON- hit a whale or something of
that sort and this fellow be a weazel what be -PRON- about say sir

only this go down with -PRON- and get what thou wantest thyself

when stubb reappear -PRON- come with a dark flask in one hand and a sort
of tea caddy in the other the first contain strong spirit and be
hand to queequeg the second be aunt charity 's gift and that be
freely give to the wave



chapter 73 stubb and flask kill a right whale and then have a talk
over him


-PRON- must be bear in mind that all this time -PRON- have a sperm whale 's
prodigious head hang to the pequod 's side but -PRON- must let -PRON-
continue hang there a while till -PRON- can get a chance to attend to -PRON-
for the present other matter press and the good -PRON- can do now for the
head be to pray heaven the tackle may hold

now during the past night and forenoon the pequod have gradually
drift into a sea which by -PRON- occasional patch of yellow brit
give unusual token of the vicinity of right whales a specie of the
leviathan that but few suppose to be at this particular time lurk
anywhere near and though all hand commonly disdain the capture of
those inferior creature and though the pequod be not commission to
cruise for -PRON- at all and though -PRON- have pass number of -PRON- near
the crozetts without lower a boat yet now that a sperm whale
have be bring alongside and behead to the surprise of all the
announcement be make that a right whale should be capture that day if
opportunity offer

nor be this long want tall spout be see to leeward and two
boat stubb 's and flask 's be detach in pursuit pull further
and further away -PRON- at last become almost invisible to the man at
the mast head but suddenly in the distance -PRON- see a great heap of
tumultuous white water and soon after news come from aloft that one or
both the boat must be fast an interval pass and the boat be in
plain sight in the act of be drag right towards the ship by the
tow whale so close do the monster come to the hull that at
first -PRON- seem as if -PRON- mean -PRON- malice but suddenly go down in a
maelstrom within three rod of the plank -PRON- wholly disappear from
view as if diving under the keel cut cut be the cry from the
ship to the boat which for one instant seem on the point of be
bring with a deadly dash against the vessel 's side but have plenty
of line yet in the tub and the whale not sound very rapidly -PRON-
pay out abundance of rope and at the same time pull with all -PRON-
may so as to get ahead of the ship for a few minute the struggle be
intensely critical for while -PRON- still slack out the tighten line
in one direction and still ply -PRON- oar in another the contend
strain threaten to take -PRON- under but -PRON- be only a few foot advance
-PRON- seek to gain and -PRON- stick to -PRON- till -PRON- do gain -PRON- when
instantly a swift tremor be feel run like lightning along the
keel as the strained line scrap beneath the ship suddenly rise
to view under -PRON- bow snap and quivering and so fling off -PRON-
dripping that the drop fall like bit of broken glass on the water
while the whale beyond also rise to sight and once more the boat be
free to fly but the fagged whale abate -PRON- speed and blindly alter
-PRON- course go round the stern of the ship tow the two boat after
-PRON- so that -PRON- perform a complete circuit

meantime -PRON- haul more and more upon -PRON- line till close
flank -PRON- on both side stubb answer flask with lance for
lance and thus round and round the pequod the battle go while the
multitude of shark that have before swum round the sperm whale 's body
rush to the fresh blood that be spill thirstily drinking at every
new gash as the eager israelites do at the new bursting fountain that
pour from the smitten rock

at last -PRON- spout grow thick and with a frightful roll and vomit -PRON-
turn upon -PRON- back a corpse

while the two headsman be engage in make fast cord to -PRON- fluke
and in other way get the mass in readiness for towing some
conversation ensue between -PRON-

-PRON- wonder what the old man want with this lump of foul lard say
stubb not without some disgust at the thought of have to do with so
ignoble a leviathan

want with -PRON- say flask coil some spare line in the boat 's bow
do -PRON- never hear that the ship which but once have a sperm whale 's
head hoist on -PRON- starboard side and at the same time a right whale 's
on the larboard do -PRON- never hear stubb that that ship can never
afterwards capsize

why not

-PRON- do not know but -PRON- hear that gamboge ghost of a fedallah say so
and -PRON- seem to know all about ship charm but -PRON- sometimes think
-PRON- will charm the ship to no good at last -PRON- do not half like that chap
stubb do -PRON- ever notice how that tusk of -PRON- be a sort of carve into
a snake 's head stubb

sink -PRON- -PRON- never look at -PRON- at all but if ever -PRON- get a chance of a
dark night and -PRON- stand hard by the bulwark and no one by look
down there flask point into the sea with a peculiar motion of
both hands--"aye will -PRON- flask -PRON- take that fedallah to be the devil in
disguise do -PRON- believe that cock and bull story about -PRON- have be
stow away on board ship -PRON- be the devil -PRON- say the reason why -PRON-
do not see -PRON- tail be because -PRON- tuck -PRON- up out of sight -PRON- carry
-PRON- coil away in -PRON- pocket -PRON- gues blast -PRON- now that -PRON- think of
-PRON- -PRON- be always want oakum to stuff into the toe of -PRON- boot

-PRON- sleep in -PRON- boot do not -PRON- -PRON- hasn't get any hammock but -PRON- have
see -PRON- lay of night in a coil of rig

no doubt and -PRON- be because of -PRON- curse tail -PRON- coil -PRON- down do ye
see in the eye of the rigging

what be the old man have so much to do with -PRON- for

strike up a swap or a bargain -PRON- suppose

bargain about what

why do ye see the old man be hard bent after that white whale and
the devil there be try to come round -PRON- and get -PRON- to swap away
-PRON- silver watch or -PRON- soul or something of that sort and then -PRON- will
surrender moby dick

pooh stubb -PRON- be skylark how can fedallah do that

-PRON- do not know flask but the devil be a curious chap and a wicked
one -PRON- tell ye why -PRON- say as how -PRON- go a sauntering into the
old flag ship once switch -PRON- tail about devilish easy and
gentlemanlike and inquire if the old governor be at home well -PRON-
be at home and ask the devil what -PRON- want the devil switch
-PRON- hoofs up and say -PRON- want john what for say the old
governor what business be that of -PRON- say the devil get
mad,--'i want to use -PRON- take -PRON- say the governor and by the
lord flask if the devil do not give john the asiatic cholera before
-PRON- get through with -PRON- -PRON- will eat this whale in one mouthful but look
sharp ain't -PRON- all ready there well then pull ahead and let 's get
the whale alongside

-PRON- think -PRON- remember some such story as -PRON- be tell say flask
when at last the two boat be slowly advance with -PRON- burden
towards the ship but -PRON- can not remember where

three spaniards adventure of those three bloody minded soladoe do
ye read -PRON- there flask -PRON- gues ye do

no never see such a book hear of -PRON- though but now tell -PRON-
stubb do -PRON- suppose that that devil -PRON- be speak of just now be
the same -PRON- say be now on board the pequod

be -PRON- the same man that help kill this whale do not the devil live
for ever who ever hear that the devil be dead do -PRON- ever see
any parson a wear mourning for the devil and if the devil have a
latch key to get into the admiral 's cabin do not -PRON- suppose -PRON- can
crawl into a porthole tell -PRON- that mr. flask

how old do -PRON- suppose fedallah be stubb

do -PRON- see that mainmast there point to the ship well that be
the figure one now take all the hoop in the pequod 's hold and string
along in a row with that mast for ought do -PRON- see well that
would not begin to be fedallah 's age nor all the cooper in creation
could not show hoop enough to make ought enough

but see here stubb -PRON- think -PRON- a little boast just now that -PRON-
mean to give fedallah a sea toss if -PRON- get a good chance now if
-PRON- be so old as all those hoop of your come to and if -PRON- be go
to live for ever what good will -PRON- do to pitch -PRON- overboard tell -PRON-
that

give -PRON- a good ducking anyhow

but -PRON- would crawl back

duck -PRON- again and keep duck -PRON-

suppose -PRON- should take -PRON- into -PRON- head to duck -PRON- though yes and
drown -PRON- what then

-PRON- should like to see -PRON- try -PRON- -PRON- would give -PRON- such a pair of black eye
that -PRON- would not dare to show -PRON- face in the admiral 's cabin again for
a long while let alone down in the orlop there where -PRON- live and
hereabout on the upper deck where -PRON- sneak so much damn the devil
flask so -PRON- suppose -PRON- be afraid of the devil who be afraid of
-PRON- except the old governor who daresn't catch -PRON- and put -PRON- in
double darbie as -PRON- deserve but let -PRON- go about kidnap
people aye and sign a bond with -PRON- that all the people the devil
kidnap -PRON- would roast for -PRON- there be a governor

do -PRON- suppose fedallah want to kidnap captain ahab

do -PRON- suppose -PRON- -PRON- will know -PRON- before long flask but -PRON- be go now
to keep a sharp look out on -PRON- and if -PRON- see anything very suspicious
go on -PRON- will just take -PRON- by the nape of -PRON- neck and say look
here beelzebub -PRON- do not do -PRON- and if -PRON- make any fuss by the lord
-PRON- will make a grab into -PRON- pocket for -PRON- tail take -PRON- to the capstan
and give -PRON- such a wrenching and heaving that -PRON- tail will come short
off at the stump do -PRON- see and then -PRON- rather gues when -PRON- find
-PRON- dock in that queer fashion -PRON- will sneak off without the poor
satisfaction of feel -PRON- tail between -PRON- leg

and what will -PRON- do with the tail stubb

do with -PRON- sell -PRON- for an ox whip when -PRON- get home what else

now do -PRON- mean what -PRON- say and have be say all along stubb

mean or not mean here -PRON- be at the ship

the boat be here hail to tow the whale on the larboard side where
fluke chain and other necessary be already prepared for secure
-PRON-

do n't -PRON- tell -PRON- so say flask yes -PRON- will soon see this right
whale 's head hoist up opposite that parmacetti 's

in good time flask 's say prove true as before the pequod steeply
lean over towards the sperm whale 's head now by the counterpoise of
both head -PRON- regain -PRON- even keel though sorely strain -PRON- may
well believe so when on one side -PRON- hoist in locke 's head -PRON- go
over that way but now on the other side hoist in kant 's and -PRON- come
back again but in very poor plight thus some mind for ever keep
trim boat oh ye foolish throw all these thunder head overboard
and then -PRON- will float light and right

in disposing of the body of a right whale when bring alongside the
ship the same preliminary proceeding commonly take place as in the
case of a sperm whale only in the latter instance the head be cut off
whole but in the former the lip and tongue be separately remove and
hoist on deck with all the well known black bone attach to what be
call the crown piece but nothing like this in the present case
have be do the carcase of both whale have drop astern and
the head laden ship not a little resemble a mule carry a pair of
overburden pannier

meantime fedallah be calmly eye the right whale 's head and ever
and anon glance from the deep wrinkle there to the line in -PRON- own
hand and ahab chance so to stand that the parsee occupy -PRON- shadow
while if the parsee 's shadow be there at all -PRON- seem only to
blend with and lengthen ahab 's as the crew toil on laplandish
speculation be bandy among -PRON- concern all these pass
thing



chapter 74 the sperm whale 's head contrasted view


here now be two great whale lay -PRON- head together let -PRON-
join -PRON- and lie together -PRON- own

of the grand order of folio leviathan the sperm whale and the right
whale be by far the most noteworthy -PRON- be the only whale regularly
hunt by man to the nantucketer -PRON- present the two extreme of all
the know variety of the whale as the external difference between
-PRON- be mainly observable in -PRON- head and as a head of each be this
moment hang from the pequod 's side and as -PRON- may freely go from one
to the other by merely step across the deck where -PRON- should like
to know will -PRON- obtain a good chance to study practical cetology
than here

in the first place -PRON- be strike by the general contrast between these
head both be massive enough in all conscience but there be a certain
mathematical symmetry in the sperm whale 's which the right whale 's sadly
lack there be more character in the sperm whale 's head as -PRON- behold
-PRON- -PRON- involuntarily yield the immense superiority to -PRON- in point
of pervade dignity in the present instance too this dignity be
heighten by the pepper and salt colour of -PRON- head at the summit
give token of advanced age and large experience in short -PRON- be what
the fisherman technically call a grey head whale

let -PRON- now note what be least dissimilar in these head namely the two
most important organ the eye and the ear far back on the side of
the head and low down near the angle of either whale 's jaw if -PRON-
narrowly search -PRON- will at last see a lashless eye which -PRON- would
fancy to be a young colt 's eye so out of all proportion be -PRON- to the
magnitude of the head

now from this peculiar sideway position of the whale 's eye -PRON- be
plain that -PRON- can never see an object which be exactly ahead no more
than -PRON- can one exactly astern in a word the position of the whale 's
eye correspond to that of a man 's ear and -PRON- may fancy for
-PRON- how -PRON- would fare with -PRON- do -PRON- sideways survey object
through -PRON- ear -PRON- would find that -PRON- could only command some
thirty degree of vision in advance of the straight side line of sight
and about thirty more behind -PRON- if -PRON- bitter foe be walk
straight towards -PRON- with dagger uplift in broad day -PRON- would not
be able to see -PRON- any more than if -PRON- be steal upon -PRON- from
behind in a word -PRON- would have two back so to speak but at the
same time also two front side front for what be -PRON- that make the
front of a man what indeed but -PRON- eye

moreover while in most other animal that -PRON- can now think of the eye
be so plant as imperceptibly to blend -PRON- visual power so as to
produce one picture and not two to the brain the peculiar position of
the whale 's eye effectually divide as -PRON- be by many cubic foot of
solid head which tower between -PRON- like a great mountain separate
two lake in valley this of course must wholly separate the
impression which each independent organ impart the whale therefore
must see one distinct picture on this side and another distinct
picture on that side while all between must be profound darkness and
nothingness to -PRON- man may in effect be say to look out on the world
from a sentry box with two join sash for -PRON- window but with the
whale these two sash be separately insert make two distinct
window but sadly impair the view this peculiarity of the whale 's
eye be a thing always to be bear in mind in the fishery and to be
remember by the reader in some subsequent scene

a curious and most puzzling question may be start concern this
visual matter as touch the leviathan but -PRON- must be content with a
hint so long as a man 's eye be open in the light the act of see
be involuntary that is -PRON- can not then help mechanically see
whatev object be before -PRON- nevertheless any one 's experience
will teach -PRON- that though -PRON- can take in an undiscriminating sweep of
thing at one glance -PRON- be quite impossible for -PRON- attentively
and completely to examine any two thing however large or however
small at one and the same instant of time never mind if -PRON- lie side
by side and touch each other but if -PRON- now come to separate these two
object and surround each by a circle of profound darkness then in
order to see one of -PRON- in such a manner as to bring -PRON- mind to
bear on -PRON- the other will be utterly exclude from -PRON- contemporary
consciousness how be -PRON- then with the whale true both -PRON- eye
in -PRON- must simultaneously act but be -PRON- brain so much more
comprehensive combine and subtle than man 's that -PRON- can at the same
moment of time attentively examine two distinct prospect one on one
side of -PRON- and the other in an exactly opposite direction if -PRON-
can then be -PRON- as marvellous a thing in -PRON- as if a man be able
simultaneously to go through the demonstration of two distinct problem
in euclid nor strictly investigate be there any incongruity in this
comparison

-PRON- may be but an idle whim but -PRON- have always seem to -PRON- that the
extraordinary vacillation of movement display by some whale when
beset by three or four boat the timidity and liability to queer
fright so common to such whale -PRON- think that all this indirectly
proceed from the helpless perplexity of volition in which -PRON-
divide and diametrically opposite power of vision must involve -PRON-

but the ear of the whale be full as curious as the eye if -PRON- be an
entire stranger to -PRON- race -PRON- may hunt over these two head
for hour and never discover that organ the ear have no external leaf
whatev and into the hole -PRON- -PRON- can hardly insert a quill so
wondrously minute be -PRON- -PRON- be lodge a little behind the eye with
respect to -PRON- ear this important difference be to be observe
between the sperm whale and the right while the ear of the former have
an external opening that of the latter be entirely and evenly cover
over with a membrane so as to be quite imperceptible from without

be -PRON- not curious that so vast a being as the whale should see the
world through so small an eye and hear the thunder through an ear which
be small than a hare 's but if -PRON- eye be broad as the lens of
herschel 's great telescope and -PRON- ear capacious as the porch of
cathedral would that make -PRON- any longer of sight or sharp of
hearing not at all why then do -PRON- try to enlarge -PRON- mind
subtilize -PRON-

let -PRON- now with whatev lever and steam engine -PRON- have at hand can not
over the sperm whale 's head that -PRON- may lie bottom up then ascend
by a ladder to the summit have a peep down the mouth and be -PRON- not
that the body be now completely separate from -PRON- with a lantern -PRON-
may descend into the great kentucky mammoth cave of -PRON- stomach but
let -PRON- hold on here by this tooth and look about -PRON- where -PRON- be what
a really beautiful and chaste look mouth from floor to ceiling
line or rather paper with a glisten white membrane glossy as
bridal satin

but come out now and look at this portentous low jaw which seem
like the long narrow lid of an immense snuff box with the hinge at one
end instead of one side if -PRON- pry -PRON- up so as to get -PRON- overhead
and expose -PRON- row of tooth -PRON- seem a terrific portcullis and such
alas -PRON- prove to many a poor wight in the fishery upon whom these
spike fall with impale force but far more terrible be -PRON- to behold
when fathom down in the sea -PRON- see some sulky whale float there
suspend with -PRON- prodigious jaw some fifteen foot long hang
straight down at right angle with -PRON- body for all the world like a
ship 's jib boom this whale be not dead -PRON- be only dispirited out of
sort perhaps hypochondriac and so supine that the hinge of -PRON-
jaw have relax leave -PRON- there in that ungainly sort of plight a
reproach to all -PRON- tribe who must no doubt imprecate lock jaws upon
-PRON-

in most case this low jaw be easily unhinge by a practise
artist be disengage and hoist on deck for the purpose of extract
the ivory tooth and furnish a supply of that hard white whalebone
with which the fisherman fashion all sort of curious article
include cane umbrella stock and handle to rid whip

with a long weary hoist the jaw be drag on board as if -PRON- be an
anchor and when the proper time come some few day after the other
work queequeg daggoo and tashtego be all accomplished dentist
be set to draw tooth with a keen cutting spade queequeg lance
the gum then the jaw be lash down to ringbolt and a tackle be
rig from aloft -PRON- drag out these tooth as michigan oxen drag
stump of old oak out of wild wood land there be generally forty two
tooth in all in old whale much wear down but undecayed nor fill
after -PRON- artificial fashion the jaw be afterwards sawn into slab and
pile away like joist for build house



chapter 75 the right whale 's head contrasted view


cross the deck let -PRON- now have a good long look at the right whale 's
head

as in general shape the noble sperm whale 's head may be compare to a
roman war chariot especially in front where -PRON- be so broadly round
so at a broad view the right whale 's head bear a rather inelegant
resemblance to a gigantic galliot toe shoe two hundred year ago an
old dutch voyager liken -PRON- shape to that of a shoemaker 's last and
in this same last or shoe that old woman of the nursery tale with
the swarm brood may very comfortably be lodge -PRON- and all -PRON-
progeny

but as -PRON- come nearer to this great head -PRON- begin to assume different
aspect accord to -PRON- point of view if -PRON- stand on -PRON- summit and
look at these two f shape spouthole -PRON- would take the whole head
for an enormous bass viol and these spiracle the aperture in -PRON-
sound board then again if -PRON- fix -PRON- eye upon this strange
crest comb like incrustation on the top of the mass this green
barnacled thing which the greenlanders call the crown and the
southern fisher the bonnet of the right whale fix -PRON- eye
solely on this -PRON- would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak
with a bird 's nest in -PRON- crotch at any rate when -PRON- watch those live
crab that nestle here on this bonnet such an idea will be almost
sure to occur to -PRON- unless indeed -PRON- fancy have be fix by the
technical term crown also bestow upon -PRON- in which case -PRON- will
take great interest in think how this mighty monster be actually a
diadem king of the sea whose green crown have be put together for
-PRON- in this marvellous manner but if this whale be a king -PRON- be a very
sulky look fellow to grace a diadem look at that hang low lip
what a huge sulk and pout be there a sulk and pout by carpenter 's
measurement about twenty foot long and five foot deep a sulk and pout
that will yield -PRON- some 500 gallon of oil and more

a great pity now that this unfortunate whale should be hare lipped
the fissure be about a foot across probably the mother during an
important interval be sail down the peruvian coast when earthquake
cause the beach to gape over this lip as over a slippery threshold
-PRON- now slide into the mouth upon -PRON- word be -PRON- at mackinaw -PRON- should
take this to be the inside of an indian wigwam good lord be this the
road that jonah go the roof be about twelve foot high and run to a
pretty sharp angle as if there be a regular ridge pole there while
these rib arch hairy side present -PRON- with those wondrous half
vertical scimetar shape slat of whalebone say three hundred on a
side which depend from the upper part of the head or crown
bone form those venetian blind which have elsewhere be cursorily
mention the edge of these bone be fringe with hairy fibre
through which the right whale strain the water and in whose
intricacy -PRON- retain the small fish when openmouth -PRON- go through
the sea of brit in feed time in the central blind of bone as -PRON-
stand in -PRON- natural order there be certain curious mark curve
hollow and ridge whereby some whaleman calculate the creature 's age
as the age of an oak by -PRON- circular ring though the certainty of this
criterion be far from demonstrable yet -PRON- have the savor of analogical
probability at any rate if -PRON- yield to -PRON- -PRON- must grant a far great
age to the right whale than at first glance will seem reasonable

in old time there seem to have prevail the most curious fancy
concern these blind one voyager in purchas call -PRON- the wondrous
whisker inside of the whale 's mouth another hog bristle a
third old gentleman in hackluyt use the follow elegant language
there be about two hundred and fifty fin grow on each side of -PRON-
upper chop which arch over -PRON- tongue on each side of -PRON- mouth


this remind -PRON- that the right whale really have a sort of whisker or
rather a moustache consist of a few scatter white hair on the
upper part of the outer end of the low jaw sometimes these
tuft impart a rather brigandish expression to -PRON- otherwise solemn
countenance


as every one know these same hog bristle fin whisker
blind or whatev -PRON- please furnish to the lady -PRON- busk and
other stiffen contrivance but in this particular the demand have
long be on the decline -PRON- be in queen anne 's time that the bone be
in -PRON- glory the farthingale be then all the fashion and as those
ancient dame move about gaily though in the jaws of the whale as
-PRON- may say even so in a shower with the like thoughtlessness do -PRON-
nowadays fly under the same jaws for protection the umbrella be a
tent spread over the same bone

but now forget all about blind and whisker for a moment and stand
in the right whale 's mouth look around -PRON- afresh see all these
colonnade of bone so methodically range about would -PRON- not think
-PRON- be inside of the great haarlem organ and gaze upon -PRON-
thousand pipe for a carpet to the organ -PRON- have a rug of the soft
turkey the tongue which be glue as -PRON- be to the floor of the
mouth -PRON- be very fat and tender and apt to tear in piece in hoist
-PRON- on deck this particular tongue now before -PRON- at a passing glance -PRON-
should say -PRON- be a six barreler that is -PRON- will yield -PRON- about that
amount of oil

ere this -PRON- must have plainly see the truth of what -PRON- start
with that the sperm whale and the right whale have almost entirely
different head to sum up then in the right whale 's there be no great
well of sperm no ivory tooth at all no long slender mandible of a
low jaw like the sperm whale 's nor in the sperm whale be there any
of those blind of bone no huge low lip and scarcely anything of a
tongue again the right whale have two external spout hole the sperm
whale only one

look -PRON- last now on these venerable hooded head while -PRON- yet lie
together for one will soon sink unrecorded in the sea the other will
not be very long in follow

can -PRON- catch the expression of the sperm whale 's there -PRON- be the same
-PRON- die with only some of the long wrinkle in the forehead seem
now fade away -PRON- think -PRON- broad brow to be full of a prairie like
placidity bear of a speculative indifference as to death but mark the
other head 's expression see that amazing low lip press by accident
against the vessel 's side so as firmly to embrace the jaw do not
this whole head seem to speak of an enormous practical resolution in
face death this right whale -PRON- take to have be a stoic the sperm
whale a platonian who may have take up spinoza in -PRON- latter year



chapter 76 the battering ram


ere quit for the nonce the sperm whale 's head -PRON- would have
-PRON- as a sensible physiologist simply particularly remark -PRON- front
aspect in all -PRON- compacted collectedness -PRON- would have -PRON- investigate
-PRON- now with the sole view of form to -PRON- some unexaggerated
intelligent estimate of whatev batter ram power may be lodge
there here be a vital point for -PRON- must either satisfactorily settle
this matter with -PRON- or for ever remain an infidel as to one of
the most appalling but not the less true event perhaps anywhere to be
find in all record history

-PRON- observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the sperm whale
the front of -PRON- head present an almost wholly vertical plane to the
water -PRON- observe that the low part of that front slope considerably
backwards so as to furnish more of a retreat for the long socket which
receive the boom like low jaw -PRON- observe that the mouth be entirely
under the head much in the same way indeed as though -PRON- own mouth
be entirely under -PRON- chin moreover -PRON- observe that the whale have
no external nose and that what nose -PRON- have -PRON- spout hole be on the
top of -PRON- head -PRON- observe that -PRON- eye and ear be at the side
of -PRON- head nearly one third of -PRON- entire length from the front
wherefore -PRON- must now have perceive that the front of the sperm
whale 's head be a dead blind wall without a single organ or tender
prominence of any sort whatsoever furthermore -PRON- be now to consider
that only in the extreme low backward sloping part of the front of
the head be there the slight vestige of bone and not till -PRON-
get near twenty foot from the forehead do -PRON- come to the full cranial
development so that this whole enormous boneless mass be as one wad
finally though as will soon be reveal -PRON- content partly comprise
the most delicate oil yet -PRON- be now to be apprise of the nature of
the substance which so impregnably invest all that apparent effeminacy
in some previous place -PRON- have describe to -PRON- how the blubber wrap the
body of the whale as the rind wrap an orange just so with the head
but with this difference about the head this envelope though not so
thick be of a boneless toughness inestimable by any man who have not
handle -PRON- the severe point harpoon the sharp lance dart by
the strong human arm impotently rebound from -PRON- -PRON- be as though
the forehead of the sperm whale be pave with horse hoofs -PRON- do not
think that any sensation lurk in -PRON-

bethink -PRON- also of another thing when two large loaded indiamen
chance to crowd and crush towards each other in the dock what do the
sailor do -PRON- do not suspend between -PRON- at the point of come
contact any merely hard substance like iron or wood no -PRON- hold
there a large round wad of tow and cork envelop in the thick
and tough of ox hide that bravely and uninjur take the jam which
would have snap all -PRON- oaken handspike and iron crow bar by
-PRON- this sufficiently illustrate the obvious fact -PRON- drive at but
supplementary to this -PRON- have hypothetically occur to -PRON- that
as ordinary fish posses what be call a swimming bladder in -PRON-
capable at will of distension or contraction and as the sperm whale
as far as -PRON- know have no such provision in -PRON- consider too
the otherwise inexplicable manner in which -PRON- now depress -PRON- head
altogether beneath the surface and anon swim with -PRON- high elevate out
of the water consider the unobstructed elasticity of -PRON- envelope
consider the unique interior of -PRON- head -PRON- have hypothetically
occur to -PRON- -PRON- say that those mystical lung cell honeycomb there
may possibly have some hitherto unknown and unsuspected connexion with
the outer air so as to be susceptible to atmospheric distension and
contraction if this be so fancy the irresistibleness of that may to
which the most impalpable and destructive of all element contribute

now mark unerringly impelling this dead impregnable uninjurable
wall and this most buoyant thing within there swim behind -PRON- all a
mass of tremendous life only to be adequately estimate as pile wood
be by the cord and all obedient to one volition as the small
insect so that when -PRON- shall hereafter detail to -PRON- all the
speciality and concentration of potency everywhere lurk in this
expansive monster when -PRON- shall show -PRON- some of -PRON- more inconsiderable
brain feat -PRON- trust -PRON- will have renounce all ignorant
incredulity and be ready to abide by this that though the sperm whale
stove a passage through the isthmus of darien and mix the atlantic
with the pacific -PRON- would not elevate one hair of -PRON- eye brow for
unless -PRON- own the whale -PRON- be but a provincial and sentimentalist
in truth but clear truth be a thing for salamander giant only to
encounter how small the chance for the provincial then what befall
the weakling youth lift the dread goddess 's veil at lais



chapter 77 the great heidelburgh tun


now come the baling of the case but to comprehend -PRON- aright -PRON- must
know something of the curious internal structure of the thing operate
upon

regard the sperm whale 's head as a solid oblong -PRON- may on an
inclined plane sideways divide -PRON- into two quoin whereof the low
be the bony structure form the cranium and jaws and the upper an
unctuous mass wholly free from bone -PRON- broad forward end form the
expand vertical apparent forehead of the whale at the middle of the
forehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin and then -PRON- have two
almost equal part which before be naturally divide by an internal
wall of a thick tendinous substance


quoin be not a euclidean term -PRON- belong to the pure nautical
mathematic -PRON- know not that -PRON- have be define before a quoin be a
solid which differ from a wedge in have -PRON- sharp end form by the
steep inclination of one side instead of the mutual tapering of both
side


the lower subdivide part call the junk be one immense honeycomb
of oil form by the crossing and recrossing into ten thousand
infiltrate cell of tough elastic white fibre throughout -PRON- whole
extent the upper part know as the case may be regard as the great
heidelburgh tun of the sperm whale and as that famous great tierce be
mystically carve in front so the whale 's vast plaited forehead form
innumerable strange device for the emblematical adornment of -PRON-
wondrous tun moreover as that of heidelburgh be always replenish
with the most excellent of the wine of the rhenish valley so the tun
of the whale contain by far the most precious of all -PRON- oily vintage
namely the highly prize spermaceti in -PRON- absolutely pure limpid
and odoriferous state nor be this precious substance find unalloyed
in any other part of the creature though in life -PRON- remain perfectly
fluid yet upon exposure to the air after death -PRON- soon begin to
concrete send forth beautiful crystalline shoot as when the
first thin delicate ice be just form in water a large whale 's
case generally yield about five hundred gallon of sperm though from
unavoidable circumstance considerable of -PRON- be spill leak and
dribble away or be otherwise irrevocably lose in the ticklish business
of secure what -PRON- can

-PRON- know not with what fine and costly material the heidelburgh tun
be coat within but in superlative richness that coating could not
possibly have compare with the silken pearl coloured membrane like the
lining of a fine pelisse form the inner surface of the sperm whale 's
case

-PRON- will have be see that the heidelburgh tun of the sperm whale
embrace the entire length of the entire top of the head and since as
have be elsewhere set forth the head embrace one third of the whole
length of the creature then set that length down at eighty foot for
a good sized whale -PRON- have more than twenty six foot for the depth
of the tun when -PRON- be lengthwise hoist up and down against a ship 's
side

as in decapitate the whale the operator 's instrument be bring close
to the spot where an entrance be subsequently force into the spermaceti
magazine -PRON- have therefore to be uncommonly heedful lest a careless
untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and wastingly let out -PRON-
invaluable content -PRON- be this decapitated end of the head also which
be at last elevate out of the water and retain in that position by
the enormous cutting tackle whose hempen combination on one side
make quite a wilderness of rope in that quarter

thus much be say attend now -PRON- pray -PRON- to that marvellous and in
this particular instance almost fatal operation whereby the sperm
whale 's great heidelburgh tun be tap



chapter 78 cistern and bucket


nimble as a cat tashtego mount aloft and without alter -PRON- erect
posture run straight out upon the overhang mainyard arm to the
part where -PRON- exactly project over the hoist tun -PRON- have carry
with -PRON- a light tackle call a whip consist of only two part
travel through a single sheav block secure this block so that
-PRON- hang down from the yard arm -PRON- swing one end of the rope till -PRON-
be catch and firmly hold by a hand on deck then hand over hand down
the other part the indian drop through the air till dexterously -PRON-
land on the summit of the head there still high elevate above the
rest of the company to whom -PRON- vivaciously cry -PRON- seem some turkish
muezzin call the good people to prayer from the top of a tower a
short handle sharp spade be send up to -PRON- -PRON- diligently search
for the proper place to begin break into the tun in this business
-PRON- proceed very heedfully like a treasure hunter in some old house
sound the wall to find where the gold be mason in by the time
this cautious search be over a stout iron bind bucket precisely like
a well bucket have be attach to one end of the whip while the other
end be stretch across the deck be there hold by two or three
alert hand these last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the indian
to whom another person have reach up a very long pole insert this
pole into the bucket tashtego downward guide the bucket into the tun
till -PRON- entirely disappear then give the word to the seaman at the
whip up come the bucket again all bubble like a dairy maid 's pail
of new milk carefully lower from -PRON- height the full freighted
vessel be catch by an appoint hand and quickly empty into a large
tub then remount aloft -PRON- again go through the same round until
the deep cistern will yield no more towards the end tashtego have to
ram -PRON- long pole harder and harder and deep and deep into the tun
until some twenty foot of the pole have go down

now the people of the pequod have be bale some time in this way
several tub have be fill with the fragrant sperm when all at once a
queer accident happen whether -PRON- be that tashtego that wild indian
be so heedless and reckless as to let go for a moment -PRON- one handed
hold on the great cable tackle suspend the head or whether the
place where -PRON- stand be so treacherous and oozy or whether the evil
one -PRON- would have -PRON- to fall out so without state -PRON- particular
reason how -PRON- be exactly there be no tell now but on a sudden
as the eightieth or ninetieth bucket come suckingly up -PRON- god poor
tashtego like the twin reciprocating bucket in a veritable well
drop head foremost down into this great tun of heidelburgh and with
a horrible oily gurgling go clean out of sight

man overboard cry daggoo who amid the general consternation first
come to -PRON- sens sw the bucket this way and put one foot
into -PRON- so as the good to secure -PRON- slippery hand hold on the whip
-PRON- the hoister run -PRON- high up to the top of the head almost
before tashtego could have reach -PRON- interior bottom meantime
there be a terrible tumult look over the side -PRON- see the before
lifeless head throb and heave just below the surface of the sea
as if that moment seize with some momentous idea whereas -PRON- be only
the poor indian unconsciously reveal by those struggle the perilous
depth to which -PRON- have sink

at this instant while daggoo on the summit of the head be clear
the whip which have somehow get foul of the great cutting tackle a
sharp cracking noise be hear and to the unspeakable horror of all
one of the two enormous hook suspend the head tear out and with
a vast vibration the enormous mass sideways swing till the drunk ship
reel and shake as if smite by an iceberg the one remain hook
upon which the entire strain now depend seem every instant to be
on the point of give way an event still more likely from the violent
motion of the head

come down come down yell the seamen to daggoo but with one hand
hold on to the heavy tackle so that if the head should drop -PRON-
would still remain suspended the negro have clear the foul line
ram down the bucket into the now collapse well mean that the
bury harpooneer should grasp -PRON- and so be hoist out

in heaven 's name man cry stubb be -PRON- ram home a cartridge
there avast how will that help -PRON- jam that iron bind bucket on
top of -PRON- head avast will ye

stand clear of the tackle cry a voice like the bursting of a
rocket

almost in the same instant with a thunder boom the enormous mass
drop into the sea like niagara 's table rock into the whirlpool the
suddenly relieve hull roll away from -PRON- to far down -PRON- glitter
copper and all catch -PRON- breath as half swing now over the
sailor head and now over the water daggoo through a thick mist of
spray be dimly beheld cling to the pendulous tackle while poor
bury alive tashtego be sink utterly down to the bottom of the sea
but hardly have the blinding vapour clear away when a naked figure
with a boarding sword in -PRON- hand be for one swift moment see
hover over the bulwark the next a loud splash announce that -PRON-
brave queequeg have dive to the rescue one pack rush be make to the
side and every eye count every ripple as moment follow moment and
no sign of either the sinker or the diver could be see some hand now
jump into a boat alongside and push a little off from the ship

ha ha cry daggoo all at once from -PRON- now quiet swing perch
overhead and look further off from the side -PRON- see an arm thrust
upright from the blue wave a sight strange to see as an arm thrust
forth from the grass over a grave

both both!--it be both!"--cri daggoo again with a joyful shout and
soon after queequeg be see boldly strike out with one hand and
with the other clutch the long hair of the indian draw into the
wait boat -PRON- be quickly bring to the deck but tashtego be
long in come to and queequeg do not look very brisk

now how have this noble rescue be accomplish why diving after
the slowly descend head queequeg with -PRON- keen sword have make
side lunge near -PRON- bottom so as to scuttle a large hole there then
drop -PRON- sword have thrust -PRON- long arm far inwards and upwards
and so haul out poor tash by the head -PRON- aver that upon first
thrust in for -PRON- a leg be present but well know that that
be not as -PRON- ought to be and may occasion great trouble -PRON- have
thrust back the leg and by a dexterous heave and toss have work a
somerset upon the indian so that with the next trial -PRON- come forth in
the good old way head foremost as for the great head -PRON- that be
do as well as could be expect

and thus through the courage and great skill in obstetric of queequeg
the deliverance or rather delivery of tashtego be successfully
accomplish in the tooth too of the most untoward and apparently
hopeless impediment which be a lesson by no mean to be forget
midwifery should be teach in the same course with fence and boxing
rid and row

-PRON- know that this queer adventure of the gay header 's will be sure to
seem incredible to some landsman though -PRON- -PRON- may have either
see or hear of some one 's fall into a cistern ashore an accident
which not seldom happen and with much less reason too than the
indian 's consider the exceed slipperiness of the curb of the
sperm whale 's well

but peradventure -PRON- may be sagaciously urge how be this -PRON- think
the tissued infiltrate head of the sperm whale be the light and
most corky part about -PRON- and yet thou makest -PRON- sink in an element of
a far great specific gravity than -PRON- -PRON- have thee there not at
all but -PRON- have ye for at the time poor tash fall in the case have be
nearly empty of -PRON- light content leave little but the dense
tendinous wall of the well a double welded hammer substance as -PRON-
have before say much heavy than the sea water and a lump of which
sink in -PRON- like lead almost but the tendency to rapid sinking in this
substance be in the present instance materially counteract by the
other part of the head remain undetach from -PRON- so that -PRON- sink
very slowly and deliberately indeed afford queequeg a fair chance
for perform -PRON- agile obstetric on the run as -PRON- may say yes -PRON-
be a running delivery so -PRON- be

now have tashtego perish in that head -PRON- have be a very precious
perishing smother in the very white and daintiest of fragrant
spermaceti coffin hears and tombed in the secret inner chamber
and sanctum sanctorum of the whale only one sweet end can readily be
recall the delicious death of an ohio honey hunter who seek honey
in the crotch of a hollow tree find such exceed store of -PRON- that
lean too far over -PRON- suck -PRON- in so that -PRON- die embalm
how many think ye have likewise fall into plato 's honey head and
sweetly perish there



chapter 79 the prairie


to scan the line of -PRON- face or feel the bump on the head of this
leviathan this be a thing which no physiognomist or phrenologist have as
yet undertake such an enterprise would seem almost as hopeful as for
lavater to have scrutinize the wrinkle on the rock of gibraltar
or for gall to have mount a ladder and manipulate the dome of the
pantheon still in that famous work of -PRON- lavater not only treat
of the various face of man but also attentively study the face
of horse bird serpent and fish and dwell in detail upon the
modification of expression discernible therein nor have gall and
-PRON- disciple spurzheim fail to throw out some hint touch the
phrenological characteristic of other being than man therefore
though -PRON- be but ill qualify for a pioneer in the application of these
two semi science to the whale -PRON- will do -PRON- endeavor -PRON- try all thing
-PRON- achieve what -PRON- can

physiognomically regard the sperm whale be an anomalous creature
-PRON- have no proper nose and since the nose be the central and most
conspicuous of the feature and since -PRON- perhaps most modifie and
finally control -PRON- combine expression hence -PRON- would seem that -PRON-
entire absence as an external appendage must very largely affect
the countenance of the whale for as in landscape gardening a spire
cupola monument or tower of some sort be deem almost indispensable
to the completion of the scene so no face can be physiognomically in
keep without the elevated open work belfry of the nose dash the nose
from phidias 's marble jove and what a sorry remainder nevertheless
leviathan be of so mighty a magnitude all -PRON- proportion be so
stately that the same deficiency which in the sculptured jove be
hideous in -PRON- be no blemish at all nay -PRON- be an add grandeur a
nose to the whale would have be impertinent as on -PRON- physiognomical
voyage -PRON- sail round -PRON- vast head in -PRON- jolly boat -PRON- noble
conception of -PRON- be never insult by the reflection that -PRON- have a
nose to be pull a pestilent conceit which so often will insist upon
obtrude even when behold the mighty royal beadle on -PRON- throne

in some particular perhaps the most impose physiognomical view to
be have of the sperm whale be that of the full front of -PRON- head this
aspect be sublime

in thought a fine human brow be like the east when trouble with the
morning in the repose of the pasture the curl brow of the bull have a
touch of the grand in -PRON- push heavy cannon up mountain defile the
elephant 's brow be majestic human or animal the mystical brow be as
that great golden seal affix by the german emperor to -PRON- decree
-PRON- signifies--"god do this day by -PRON- hand but in most creature
nay in man -PRON- very often the brow be but a mere strip of alpine
land lie along the snow line few be the forehead which like
shakespeare 's or melancthon 's rise so high and descend so low that the
eye -PRON- seem clear eternal tideless mountain lake and all
above -PRON- in the forehead 's wrinkle -PRON- seem to track the antler
thought descend there to drink as the highland hunter track the
snow print of the deer but in the great sperm whale this high and
mighty god like dignity inherent in the brow be so immensely amplify
that gaze on -PRON- in that full front view -PRON- feel the deity and the
dread power more forcibly than in behold any other object in live
nature for -PRON- see no one point precisely not one distinct feature be
reveal no nose eye ear or mouth no face -PRON- have none proper
nothing but that one broad firmament of a forehead pleat with
riddle dumbly lower with the doom of boat and ship and man
nor in profile do this wondrous brow diminish though that way
view -PRON- grandeur do not domineer upon -PRON- so in profile -PRON-
plainly perceive that horizontal semi crescentic depression in the
forehead 's middle which in man be lavater 's mark of genius

but how genius in the sperm whale have the sperm whale ever write
a book speak a speech no -PRON- great genius be declare in -PRON-
do nothing particular to prove -PRON- -PRON- be moreover declare in -PRON-
pyramidical silence and this remind -PRON- that have the great sperm whale
be know to the young orient world -PRON- would have be deify by
-PRON- child magian thought -PRON- deify the crocodile of the nile
because the crocodile be tongueless and the sperm whale have no
tongue or at least -PRON- be so exceedingly small as to be incapable of
protrusion if hereafter any highly cultured poetical nation shall lure
back to -PRON- birth right the merry may day god of old and livingly
enthrone -PRON- again in the now egotistical sky in the now unhaunted
hill then be sure exalt to jove 's high seat the great sperm whale
shall lord -PRON-

champollion decipher the wrinkled granite hieroglyphic but there be
no champollion to decipher the egypt of every man 's and every being 's
face physiognomy like every other human science be but a passing
fable if then sir william jones who read in thirty language could
not read the simple peasant 's face in -PRON- profounder and more subtle
meaning how may unlettered ishmael hope to read the awful chaldee of
the sperm whale 's brow -PRON- but put that brow before -PRON- read -PRON- if -PRON-
can



chapter 80 the nut


if the sperm whale be physiognomically a sphinx to the phrenologist -PRON-
brain seem that geometrical circle which -PRON- be impossible to square

in the full grown creature the skull will measure at least twenty foot
in length unhinge the low jaw and the side view of this skull be as
the side of a moderately incline plane rest throughout on a level
base but in life as -PRON- have elsewhere see this inclined plane be
angularly fill up and almost square by the enormous superincumbent
mass of the junk and sperm at the high end the skull form a crater to
bed that part of the mass while under the long floor of this crater in
another cavity seldom exceed ten inch in length and as many in
depth repose the mere handful of this monster 's brain the brain be at
least twenty foot from -PRON- apparent forehead in life -PRON- be hidden
away behind -PRON- vast outwork like the innermost citadel within the
amplify fortification of quebec so like a choice casket be -PRON-
secrete in -PRON- that -PRON- have know some whaleman who peremptorily deny
that the sperm whale have any other brain than that palpable semblance
of one form by the cubic yard of -PRON- sperm magazine lie in strange
fold course and convolution to -PRON- apprehension -PRON- seem more
in keep with the idea of -PRON- general might to regard that mystic part
of -PRON- as the seat of -PRON- intelligence

-PRON- be plain then that phrenologically the head of this leviathan in
the creature 's live intact state be an entire delusion as for -PRON-
true brain -PRON- can then see no indication of -PRON- nor feel any the
whale like all thing that be mighty wear a false brow to the common
world

if -PRON- unload -PRON- skull of -PRON- spermy heap and then take a rear view
of -PRON- rear end which be the high end -PRON- will be strike by -PRON-
resemblance to the human skull beheld in the same situation and from
the same point of view indeed place this reverse skull scale down
to the human magnitude among a plate of man 's skull and -PRON- would
involuntarily confound -PRON- with -PRON- and remark the depression on
one part of -PRON- summit in phrenological phrase -PRON- would say this
man have no self esteem and no veneration and by those negation
consider along with the affirmative fact of -PRON- prodigious bulk and
power -PRON- can best form to -PRON- the true though not the most
exhilarate conception of what the most exalted potency be

but if from the comparative dimension of the whale 's proper brain -PRON-
deem -PRON- incapable of be adequately chart then -PRON- have another idea
for -PRON- if -PRON- attentively regard almost any quadruped 's spine
-PRON- will be strike with the resemblance of -PRON- vertebra to a strung
necklace of dwarfed skull all bear rudimental resemblance to the
skull proper -PRON- be a german conceit that the vertebra be absolutely
undeveloped skull but the curious external resemblance -PRON- take -PRON-
the germans be not the first man to perceive a foreign friend once
point -PRON- out to -PRON- in the skeleton of a foe -PRON- have slay and with
the vertebrae of which -PRON- be inlay in a sort of basso relievo the
beak prow of -PRON- canoe now -PRON- consider that the phrenologist have
omit an important thing in not push -PRON- investigation from the
cerebellum through the spinal canal for -PRON- believe that much of a man 's
character will be find betoken in -PRON- backbone -PRON- would rather feel
-PRON- spine than -PRON- skull whoever -PRON- be a thin joist of a spine
never yet uphold a full and noble soul -PRON- rejoice in -PRON- spine as in the
firm audacious staff of that flag which -PRON- fl half out to the world

apply this spinal branch of phrenology to the sperm whale -PRON- cranial
cavity be continuous with the first neck vertebra and in that vertebra
the bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inch across be
eight in height and of a triangular figure with the base downward as
-PRON- pass through the remain vertebrae the canal taper in size but
for a considerable distance remain of large capacity now of course
this canal be fill with much the same strangely fibrous substance the
spinal cord as the brain and directly communicate with the brain
and what be still more for many foot after emerge from the brain 's
cavity the spinal cord remain of an undecreasing girth almost
equal to that of the brain under all these circumstance would -PRON- be
unreasonable to survey and map out the whale 's spine phrenologically
for view in this light the wonderful comparative smallness of -PRON-
brain proper be more than compensate by the wonderful comparative
magnitude of -PRON- spinal cord

but leave this hint to operate as -PRON- may with the phrenologist -PRON-
would merely assume the spinal theory for a moment in reference to the
sperm whale 's hump this august hump if -PRON- mistake not rise over one
of the large vertebrae and be therefore in some sort the outer
convex mould of -PRON- from -PRON- relative situation then -PRON- should call this
high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness in the sperm whale
and that the great monster be indomitable -PRON- will yet have reason to
know



chapter 81 the pequod meets the virgin


the predestinated day arrive and -PRON- duly meet the ship jungfrau derick
de deer master of bremen

at one time the great whaling people in the world the dutch and
german be now among the least but here and there at very wide
interval of latitude and longitude -PRON- still occasionally meet with
-PRON- flag in the pacific

for some reason the jungfrau seem quite eager to pay -PRON- respect
while yet some distance from the pequod -PRON- round to and drop a
boat -PRON- captain be impel towards -PRON- impatiently stand in the
bow instead of the stern

what have -PRON- in -PRON- hand there cry starbuck point to something
wavingly hold by the german impossible!--a lamp feeder

not that say stubb no no -PRON- be a coffee pot mr. starbuck -PRON- be
come off to make -PRON- -PRON- coffee be the yarman do not -PRON- see that big
tin can there alongside of -PRON- that be -PRON- boiling water oh -PRON- be all
right be the yarman

go along with -PRON- cry flask -PRON- be a lamp feeder and an oil can
-PRON- be out of oil and have come a begging

however curious -PRON- may seem for an oil ship to be borrow oil on the
whale ground and however much -PRON- may invertedly contradict the old
proverb about carry coal to newcastle yet sometimes such a thing
really happen and in the present case captain derick de deer do
indubitably conduct a lamp feeder as flask do declare

as -PRON- mount the deck ahab abruptly accost -PRON- without at all
heed what -PRON- have in -PRON- hand but in -PRON- broken lingo the german
soon evince -PRON- complete ignorance of the white whale immediately
turn the conversation to -PRON- lamp feeder and oil can with some
remark touch -PRON- have to turn into -PRON- hammock at night in
profound darkness -PRON- last drop of bremen oil be go and not a
single flying fish yet capture to supply the deficiency conclude
by hint that -PRON- ship be indeed what in the fishery be technically
call a clean one that be an empty one well deserve the name of
jungfrau or the virgin

-PRON- necessity supply derick depart but -PRON- have not gain -PRON-
ship 's side when whale be almost simultaneously raise from the
mast head of both vessel and so eager for the chase be derick that
without pause to put -PRON- oil can and lamp feeder aboard -PRON- slew
round -PRON- boat and make after the leviathan lamp feeder

now the game have rise to leeward -PRON- and the other three german
boat that soon follow -PRON- have considerably the start of the pequod 's
keel there be eight whale an average pod aware of -PRON- danger
-PRON- be go all abreast with great speed straight before the wind
rub -PRON- flank as closely as so many span of horse in harness
-PRON- leave a great wide wake as though continually unroll a great
wide parchment upon the sea

full in this rapid wake and many fathom in the rear swim a huge
hump old bull which by -PRON- comparatively slow progress as well as
by the unusual yellowish incrustation overgrow -PRON- seem afflict
with the jaundice or some other infirmity whether this whale belong
to the pod in advance seem questionable for -PRON- be not customary for
such venerable leviathan to be at all social nevertheless -PRON- stick
to -PRON- wake though indeed -PRON- back water must have retard -PRON-
because the white bone or swell at -PRON- broad muzzle be a dash one
like the swell form when two hostile current meet -PRON- spout be
short slow and laborious come forth with a choke sort of gush
and spend -PRON- in torn shreds follow by strange subterranean
commotion in -PRON- which seem to have egress at -PRON- other bury
extremity cause the water behind -PRON- to upbubble

who be get some paregoric say stubb -PRON- have the stomach ache -PRON- be
afraid lord think of have half an acre of stomach ache adverse
wind be hold mad christmas in -PRON- boy -PRON- be the first foul wind
-PRON- ever know to blow from astern but look do ever whale yaw so before
-PRON- must be -PRON- be lose -PRON- tiller

as an overladen indiaman bear down the hindostan coast with a deck
load of frightened horse careen burie roll and wallow on -PRON-
way so do this old whale heave -PRON- aged bulk and now and then partly
turn over on -PRON- cumbrous rib end expose the cause of -PRON- devious
wake in the unnatural stump of -PRON- starboard fin whether -PRON- have lose
that fin in battle or have be bear without -PRON- -PRON- be hard to say

only wait a bit old chap and -PRON- will give ye a sling for that wound
arm cry cruel flask point to the whale line near -PRON-

mind -PRON- do not sl thee with -PRON- cry starbuck give way or the
german will have -PRON-

with one intent all the combine rival boat be point for this
one fish because not only be -PRON- the large and therefore the most
valuable whale but -PRON- be near to -PRON- and the other whale be
go with such great velocity moreover as almost to defy pursuit
for the time at this juncture the pequod 's keel have shoot by the three
german boat last lower but from the great start -PRON- have have derick 's
boat still lead the chase though every moment near by -PRON- foreign
rival the only thing -PRON- fear be that from be already so
nigh to -PRON- mark -PRON- would be enable to dart -PRON- iron before -PRON-
could completely overtake and pass -PRON- as for derick -PRON- seem quite
confident that this would be the case and occasionally with a deride
gesture shake -PRON- lamp feeder at the other boat

the ungracious and ungrateful dog cry starbuck -PRON- mock and dare
-PRON- with the very poor box -PRON- fill for -PRON- not five minute ago!"--then
in -PRON- old intense whisper--"give way greyhound dog to -PRON-

-PRON- tell ye what -PRON- be man cry stubb to -PRON- crew--"it 's against
-PRON- religion to get mad but -PRON- would like to eat that villainous
yarman pull won't ye be ye go to let that rascal beat ye do
ye love brandy a hogshead of brandy then to the good man come
why do not some of ye burst a blood vessel who be that be drop an
anchor overboard -PRON- do not budge an inch we're becalm halloo here be
grass grow in the boat 's bottom and by the lord the mast there be
budding this will not do boy look at that yarman the short and long of
-PRON- be man will ye spit fire or not

oh see the suds -PRON- make cry flask dance up and down--"what
a hump oh do pile on the beef lay like a log oh -PRON- lad do
spring slap jack and quahog for supper -PRON- know -PRON- lad bake
clam and muffin oh do do spring -PRON- be a hundred barreller don't
lose -PRON- now don't oh don't!--see that yarman oh will not ye pull for
-PRON- duff -PRON- lad such a sog such a sogger do not ye love sperm
there go three thousand dollar men!--a bank!--a whole bank the bank
of england!--oh do do do!--what be that yarman about now

at this moment derick be in the act of pitch -PRON- lamp feeder at the
advance boat and also -PRON- oil can perhaps with the double view
of retard -PRON- rival way and at the same time economically
accelerate -PRON- own by the momentary impetus of the backward toss

the unmannerly dutch dogger cry stubb pull now man like fifty
thousand line of battle ship load of red haired devil what d'ye say
tashtego be -PRON- the man to snap -PRON- spine in two and twenty piece
for the honour of old gayhead what d'ye say

-PRON- say pull like god dam cry the indian

fiercely but evenly incite by the taunt of the german the pequod 's
three boat now begin range almost abreast and so disposed
momentarily near -PRON- in that fine loose chivalrous attitude of
the headsman when draw near to -PRON- prey the three mate stand up
proudly occasionally back the after oarsman with an exhilarate cry
of there -PRON- slide now hurrah for the white ash breeze down with
the yarman sail over -PRON-

but so decide an original start have derick have that spite of all
-PRON- gallantry -PRON- would have prove the victor in this race have not
a righteous judgment descend upon -PRON- in a crab which catch the blade
of -PRON- midship oarsman while this clumsy lubber be strive to free
-PRON- white ash and while in consequence derick 's boat be nigh to
capsizing and -PRON- thunder away at -PRON- man in a mighty rage that be
a good time for starbuck stubb and flask with a shout -PRON- take a
mortal start forward and slantingly range up on the german 's quarter
an instant more and all four boat be diagonically in the whale 's
immediate wake while stretch from -PRON- on both side be the
foam swell that -PRON- make

-PRON- be a terrific most pitiable and maddening sight the whale be
now go head out and send -PRON- spout before -PRON- in a continual
torment jet while -PRON- one poor fin beat -PRON- side in an agony of
fright now to this hand now to that -PRON- yaw in -PRON- faltering flight
and still at every billow that -PRON- break -PRON- spasmodically sink in the
sea or sideways roll towards the sky -PRON- one beating fin so have -PRON-
see a bird with clipped wing make affright break circle in the
air vainly strive to escape the piratical hawk but the bird have a
voice and with plaintive cry will make known -PRON- fear but the fear
of this vast dumb brute of the sea be chain up and enchant in -PRON-
-PRON- have no voice save that choke respiration through -PRON- spiracle
and this make the sight of -PRON- unspeakably pitiable while still in -PRON-
amazing bulk portcullis jaw and omnipotent tail there be enough to
appal the stout man who so pity

see now that but a very few moment more would give the pequod 's
boat the advantage and rather than be thus foil of -PRON- game derick
choose to hazard what to -PRON- must have seem a most unusually long dart
ere the last chance would for ever escape

but no sooner do -PRON- harpooneer stand up for the stroke than all three
tiger queequeg tashtego daggoo instinctively spring to -PRON- foot
and stand in a diagonal row simultaneously point -PRON- barb and
dart over the head of the german harpooneer -PRON- three nantucket
iron enter the whale blind vapour of foam and white fire the
three boat in the first fury of the whale 's headlong rush bump
the german 's aside with such force that both derick and -PRON- baffle
harpooneer be spill out and sail over by the three fly keel

do n't be afraid -PRON- butter box cry stubb cast a passing
glance upon -PRON- as -PRON- shoot by ye'll be pick up presently all
right -PRON- see some shark astern st bernard 's dog -PRON- know relieve
distressed traveller hurrah this be the way to sail now every keel a
sunbeam hurrah!--here -PRON- go like three tin kettle at the tail of a mad
cougar this put -PRON- in mind of fasten to an elephant in a tilbury on
a plain make the wheel spoke fly boy when -PRON- fasten to -PRON- that
way and there be danger of be pitch out too when -PRON- strike a
hill hurrah this be the way a fellow feel when -PRON- be go to davy
jone all a rush down an endless inclined plane hurrah this whale
carry the everlasting mail

but the monster 's run be a brief one give a sudden gasp -PRON-
tumultuously sound with a grating rush the three line fly round
the loggerhead with such a force as to gouge deep groove in -PRON-
while so fearful be the harpooneer that this rapid sounding would
soon exhaust the line that use all -PRON- dexterous might -PRON-
catch repeat smoking turn with the rope to hold on till at
last owe to the perpendicular strain from the lead line chock of
the boat whence the three rope go straight down into the blue the
gunwale of the bow be almost even with the water while the three
stern tilt high in the air and the whale soon cease to sound
for some time -PRON- remain in that attitude fearful of expend more
line though the position be a little ticklish but though boat have
be take down and lose in this way yet -PRON- be this hold on as -PRON-
be call this hook up by the sharp barb of -PRON- live flesh from
the back this -PRON- be that often torment the leviathan into soon rise
again to meet the sharp lance of -PRON- foe yet not to speak of the peril
of the thing -PRON- be to be doubt whether this course be always the
good for -PRON- be but reasonable to presume that the longer the stricken
whale stay under water the more -PRON- be exhaust because owe to the
enormous surface of -PRON- in a full grown sperm whale something less than
2000 square foot the pressure of the water be immense -PRON- all know
what an astonishing atmospheric weight -PRON- -PRON- stand up under even
here above ground in the air how vast then the burden of a whale
bear on -PRON- back a column of two hundred fathom of ocean -PRON- must at
least equal the weight of fifty atmosphere one whaleman have estimate
-PRON- at the weight of twenty line of battle ship with all -PRON- gun
and store and man on board

as the three boat lie there on that gently roll sea gaze down
into -PRON- eternal blue noon and as not a single groan or cry of any
sort nay not so much as a ripple or a bubble come up from -PRON- depth
what landsman would have think that beneath all that silence and
placidity the utmost monster of the sea be writhe and wrench in
agony not eight inch of perpendicular rope be visible at the bow
seems -PRON- credible that by three such thin thread the great leviathan
be suspend like the big weight to an eight day clock suspend and
to what to three bit of board be this the creature of whom -PRON- be
once so triumphantly said--"canst thou fill -PRON- skin with barbed iron
or -PRON- head with fish spear the sword of -PRON- that layeth at -PRON- can not
hold the spear the dart nor the habergeon -PRON- esteemeth iron as
straw the arrow can not make -PRON- flee dart be count as stubble
-PRON- laugheth at the shaking of a spear this the creature this -PRON- oh
that unfulfilment should follow the prophet for with the strength
of a thousand thigh in -PRON- tail leviathan have run -PRON- head under the
mountain of the sea to hide -PRON- from the pequod 's fish spear

in that sloping afternoon sunlight the shadow that the three boat
send down beneath the surface must have be long enough and broad
enough to shade half xerxes army who can tell how appalling to the
wound whale must have be such huge phantom flit over -PRON- head

stand by man -PRON- stir cry starbuck as the three line suddenly
vibrate in the water distinctly conduct upward to -PRON- as by
magnetic wire the life and death throb of the whale so that every
oarsman feel -PRON- in -PRON- seat the next moment relieve in great part
from the downward strain at the bow the boat give a sudden bounce
upwards as a small icefield will when a dense herd of white bear be
scared from -PRON- into the sea

haul in haul in cry starbuck again -PRON- be rise

the line of which hardly an instant before not one hand 's breadth
could have be gain be now in long quick coil fling back all
drip into the boat and soon the whale break water within two
ship 's length of the hunter

-PRON- motion plainly denote -PRON- extreme exhaustion in most land animal
there be certain valve or flood gate in many of -PRON- vein whereby
when wound the blood be in some degree at least instantly shut off in
certain direction not so with the whale one of whose peculiarity
-PRON- be to have an entire non valvular structure of the blood vessel so
that when pierce even by so small a point as a harpoon a deadly
drain be at once begin upon -PRON- whole arterial system and when this be
heighten by the extraordinary pressure of water at a great distance
below the surface -PRON- life may be say to pour from -PRON- in incessant
stream yet so vast be the quantity of blood in -PRON- and so distant
and numerous -PRON- interior fountain that -PRON- will keep thus bleed and
bleed for a considerable period even as in a drought a river will
flow whose source be in the well spring of far off and undiscernible
hill even now when the boat pull upon this whale and perilously
draw over -PRON- sway fluke and the lance be dart into -PRON-
-PRON- be follow by steady jet from the new make wound which keep
continually play while the natural spout hole in -PRON- head be only
at interval however rapid send -PRON- affrighted moisture into the
air from this last vent no blood yet come because no vital part of -PRON-
have thus far be strike -PRON- life as -PRON- significantly call -PRON- be
untouched

as the boat now more closely surround -PRON- the whole upper part of
-PRON- form with much of -PRON- that be ordinarily submerge be plainly
reveal -PRON- eye or rather the place where -PRON- eye have be be
beheld as strange misgrown mass gather in the knot hole of the
noblest oak when prostrate so from the point which the whale 's eye
have once occupy now protrude blind bulb horribly pitiable to see
but pity there be none for all -PRON- old age and -PRON- one arm and -PRON-
blind eye -PRON- must die the death and be murder in order to light the
gay bridal and other merry making of man and also to illuminate the
solemn church that preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to all
still roll in -PRON- blood at last -PRON- partially disclose a strangely
discoloured bunch or protuberance the size of a bushel low down on the
flank

a nice spot cry flask just let -PRON- prick -PRON- there once

avast cry starbuck there be no need of that

but humane starbuck be too late at the instant of the dart an
ulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound and goad by -PRON- into more than
sufferable anguish the whale now spout thick blood with swift fury
blindly dart at the craft bespatter -PRON- and -PRON- glory crew
all over with shower of gore capsize flask 's boat and mar the
bow -PRON- be -PRON- death stroke for by this time so spend be -PRON- by
loss of blood that -PRON- helplessly roll away from the wreck -PRON- have
make lay pant on -PRON- side impotently flap with -PRON- stumped fin
then over and over slowly revolve like a waning world turn up
the white secret of -PRON- belly lay like a log and die -PRON- be most
piteous that last expire spout as when by unseen hand the water
be gradually draw off from some mighty fountain and with half stifle
melancholy gurgling the spray column lower and lower to the
ground so the last long die spout of the whale

soon while the crew be await the arrival of the ship the body
show symptom of sink with all -PRON- treasure unrifl immediately
by starbuck 's order line be secure to -PRON- at different point so
that ere long every boat be a buoy the sunken whale be suspend a
few inch beneath -PRON- by the cord by very heedful management when
the ship draw nigh the whale be transfer to -PRON- side and be
strongly secure there by the stiff fluke chain for -PRON- be plain
that unless artificially uphold the body would at once sink to the
bottom

-PRON- so chance that almost upon first cut into -PRON- with the spade
the entire length of a corroded harpoon be find imbed in -PRON- flesh
on the low part of the bunch before describe but as the stump of
harpoon be frequently find in the dead body of capture whale
with the flesh perfectly heal around -PRON- and no prominence of any
kind to denote -PRON- place therefore there must need have be
some other unknown reason in the present case fully to account for
the ulceration allude to but still more curious be the fact of a
lance head of stone be find in -PRON- not far from the bury iron
the flesh perfectly firm about -PRON- who have dart that stone lance and
when -PRON- may have be dart by some nor west indian long before
america be discover

what other marvel may have be rummage out of this monstrous
cabinet there be no telling but a sudden stop be put to further
discovery by the ship 's be unprecedentedly drag over sideways
to the sea owe to the body 's immensely increase tendency to sink
however starbuck who have the ordering of affair hang on to -PRON- to the
last hang on to -PRON- so resolutely indeed that when at length the ship
would have be capsize if still persist in lock arm with the
body then when the command be give to break clear from -PRON- such be
the immovable strain upon the timber head to which the fluke chain and
cable be fastened that -PRON- be impossible to cast -PRON- off meantime
everything in the pequod be aslant to cross to the other side of the
deck be like walk up the steep gabl roof of a house the ship
groan and gasp many of the ivory inlaying of -PRON- bulwark and
cabin be start from -PRON- place by the unnatural dislocation
in vain handspike and crow be bring to bear upon the immovable
fluke chain to pry -PRON- adrift from the timberhead and so low
have the whale now settle that the submerged end could not be at all
approach while every moment whole ton of ponderosity seem add to
the sink bulk and the ship seem on the point of go over

hold on hold on will not ye cry stubb to the body do n't be in such
a devil of a hurry to sink by thunder man -PRON- must do something or go
for -PRON- no use pry there avast -PRON- say with -PRON- handspike and run
one of ye for a prayer book and a pen knife and cut the big chain

knife aye aye cry queequeg and seize the carpenter 's heavy
hatchet -PRON- lean out of a porthole and steel to iron begin slash
at the large fluke chain but a few stroke full of spark be
give when the exceed strain effect the rest with a terrific
snap every fastening go adrift the ship right the carcase sink

now this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently kill sperm
whale be a very curious thing nor have any fisherman yet adequately
account for -PRON- usually the dead sperm whale float with great
buoyancy with -PRON- side or belly considerably elevate above the
surface if the only whale that thus sink be old meagre and
break hearted creature -PRON- pad of lard diminish and all -PRON-
bone heavy and rheumatic then -PRON- may with some reason assert that
this sinking be cause by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish so
sink consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in -PRON- but -PRON-
be not so for young whale in the high health and swell with
noble aspiration prematurely cut off in the warm flush and may of
life with all -PRON- panting lard about -PRON- even these brawny buoyant
hero do sometimes sink

be -PRON- say however that the sperm whale be far less liable to this
accident than any other specie where one of that sort go down twenty
right whales do this difference in the species be no doubt imputable in
no small degree to the great quantity of bone in the right whale
-PRON- venetian blind alone sometimes weigh more than a ton from this
incumbrance the sperm whale be wholly free but there be instance
where after the lapse of many hour or several day the sunken whale
again rise more buoyant than in life but the reason of this
be obvious gas be generate in -PRON- -PRON- swell to a prodigious
magnitude become a sort of animal balloon a line of battle ship could
hardly keep -PRON- under then in the shore whaling on sounding among
the bays of new zealand when a right whale give token of sink -PRON-
fasten buoy to -PRON- with plenty of rope so that when the body have go
down -PRON- know where to look for -PRON- when -PRON- shall have ascend again

-PRON- be not long after the sinking of the body that a cry be hear from
the pequod 's mast head announce that the jungfrau be again lower
-PRON- boat though the only spout in sight be that of a fin back
belong to the specie of uncapturable whale because of -PRON-
incredible power of swimming nevertheless the fin back 's spout be so
similar to the sperm whale 's that by unskilful fisherman -PRON- be often
mistaken for -PRON- and consequently derick and all -PRON- host be now in
valiant chase of this unnearable brute the virgin crowd all sail
make after -PRON- four young keel and thus -PRON- all disappear far to
leeward still in bold hopeful chase

oh many be the fin backs and many be the dericks -PRON- friend



chapter 82 the honour and glory of whaling


there be some enterprise in which a careful disorderliness be the true
method

the more -PRON- dive into this matter of whaling and push -PRON- research up
to the very spring head of -PRON- so much the more be -PRON- impressed with -PRON-
great honourableness and antiquity and especially when -PRON- find so many
great demi god and hero prophet of all sort who one way or other
have shed distinction upon -PRON- -PRON- be transport with the reflection
that -PRON- -PRON- belong though but subordinately to so emblazoned a
fraternity

the gallant perseus a son of jupiter be the first whaleman and
to the eternal honour of -PRON- calling be -PRON- say that the first whale
attack by -PRON- brotherhood be not kill with any sordid intent those
be the knightly day of -PRON- profession when -PRON- only bear arm to
succor the distressed and not to fill man 's lamp feeder every one
know the fine story of perseus and andromeda how the lovely andromeda
the daughter of a king be tie to a rock on the sea coast and as
leviathan be in the very act of carry -PRON- off perseus the prince
of whaleman intrepidly advance harpooned the monster and deliver
and marry the maid -PRON- be an admirable artistic exploit rarely
achieve by the good harpooneer of the present day inasmuch as this
leviathan be slay at the very first dart and let no man doubt this
arkite story for in the ancient joppa now jaffa on the syrian coast
in one of the pagan temple there stand for many age the vast skeleton
of a whale which the city 's legend and all the inhabitant assert to
be the identical bone of the monster that perseus slew when the romans
take joppa the same skeleton be carry to italy in triumph what
seem most singular and suggestively important in this story be this
-PRON- be from joppa that jonah set sail

akin to the adventure of perseus and andromeda indeed by some suppose
to be indirectly derive from -PRON- be that famous story of st. george and
the dragon which dragon -PRON- maintain to have be a whale for in many
old chronicle whale and dragon be strangely jumbled together and
often stand for each other thou art as a lion of the water and as a
dragon of the sea saith ezekiel hereby plainly mean a whale
in truth some version of the bible use that word -PRON- besides -PRON-
would much subtract from the glory of the exploit have st. george but
encounter a crawl reptile of the land instead of do battle
with the great monster of the deep any man may kill a snake but only a
perseus a st. george a coffin have the heart in -PRON- to march boldly
up to a whale

let not the modern painting of this scene mislead -PRON- for though
the creature encounter by that valiant whaleman of old be vaguely
represent of a griffin like shape and though the battle be depict
on land and the saint on horseback yet consider the great ignorance
of those time when the true form of the whale be unknown to artist
and consider that as in perseus case st. george 's whale may have
crawl up out of the sea on the beach and consider that the animal
ride by st. george may have be only a large seal or sea horse
bear all this in mind -PRON- will not appear altogether incompatible
with the sacred legend and the ancient draught of the scene to
hold this so call dragon no other than the great leviathan -PRON- in
fact place before the strict and pierce truth this whole story will
fare like that fish flesh and fowl idol of the philistines dagon by
name who be plant before the ark of israel -PRON- horse 's head and
both the palm of -PRON- hand fall off from -PRON- and only the stump or
fishy part of -PRON- remain thus then one of -PRON- own noble stamp even
a whaleman be the tutelary guardian of england and by good right -PRON-
harpooneer of nantucket should be enrol in the most noble order
of st. george and therefore let not the knight of that honourable
company none of whom -PRON- venture to say have ever have to do with a
whale like -PRON- great patron let -PRON- never eye a nantucketer with
disdain since even in -PRON- woollen frock and tar trowser -PRON- be
much better entitle to st. george 's decoration than -PRON-

whether to admit hercules among -PRON- or not concern this -PRON- long
remain dubious for though accord to the greek mythology that
antique crockett and kit carson that brawny doer of rejoice good
deed be swallow down and throw up by a whale still whether
that strictly make a whaleman of -PRON- that may be moot -PRON- nowhere
appear that -PRON- ever actually harpoon -PRON- fish unless indeed
from the inside nevertheless -PRON- may be deem a sort of involuntary
whaleman at any rate the whale catch -PRON- if -PRON- do not the whale -PRON-
claim -PRON- for one of -PRON- clan

but by the good contradictory authority this grecian story of
hercules and the whale be consider to be derive from the still more
ancient hebrew story of jonah and the whale and vice versa certainly
-PRON- be very similar if -PRON- claim the demigod then why not the prophet

nor do hero saint demigod and prophet alone comprise the whole
roll of -PRON- order -PRON- grand master be still to be name for like royal
king of old time -PRON- find the head water of -PRON- fraternity in nothing
short of the great god -PRON- that wondrous oriental story be now
to be rehearse from the shaster which give -PRON- the dread vishnoo one
of the three person in the godhead of the hindoos give -PRON- this divine
vishnoo -PRON- for -PRON- lord vishnoo who by the first of -PRON- ten
earthly incarnation have for ever set apart and sanctify the whale
when brahma or the god of god saith the shaster resolve to recreate
the world after one of -PRON- periodical dissolution -PRON- give birth to
vishnoo to preside over the work but the vedas or mystical book
whose perusal would seem to have be indispensable to vishnoo before
begin the creation and which therefore must have contain
something in the shape of practical hint to young architect these
vedas be lie at the bottom of the water so vishnoo become
incarnate in a whale and sound down in -PRON- to the uttermost depth
rescue the sacred volume be not this vishnoo a whaleman then even
as a man who rid a horse be call a horseman

perseus st. george hercules jonah and vishnoo there be a member roll
for -PRON- what club but the whaleman 's can head off like that



chapter 83 jonah historically regard


reference be make to the historical story of jonah and the whale in the
precede chapter now some nantucketer rather distrust this historical
story of jonah and the whale but then there be some sceptical greeks
and romans who stand out from the orthodox pagan of -PRON- time
equally doubt the story of hercules and the whale and arion and the
dolphin and yet -PRON- doubt those tradition do not make those
tradition one whit the less fact for all that

one old sag harbor whaleman 's chief reason for question the hebrew
story be this -PRON- have one of those quaint old fashioned bible
embellish with curious unscientific plate one of which represent
jonah 's whale with two spout in -PRON- head a peculiarity only true
with respect to a specie of the leviathan the right whale and the
variety of that order concern which the fisherman have this
say a penny roll would choke -PRON- -PRON- swallow be so very small
but to this bishop jebb 's anticipative answer be ready -PRON- be not
necessary hint the bishop that -PRON- consider jonah as tombed in the
whale 's belly but as temporarily lodge in some part of -PRON- mouth and
this seem reasonable enough in the good bishop for truly the
right whale 's mouth would accommodate a couple of whist table and
comfortably seat all the player possibly too jonah may have
ensconce -PRON- in a hollow tooth but on second thought the right
whale be toothless

another reason which sag harbor -PRON- go by that name urge for -PRON-
want of faith in this matter of the prophet be something obscurely in
reference to -PRON- incarcerated body and the whale 's gastric juice but
this objection likewise fall to the ground because a german exegetist
suppos that jonah must have take refuge in the float body of a
dead whale even as the french soldier in the russian campaign turn
-PRON- dead horse into tent and crawl into -PRON- besides -PRON- have
be divine by other continental commentator that when jonah be
throw overboard from the joppa ship -PRON- straightway effect -PRON- escape
to another vessel near by some vessel with a whale for a figure head
and -PRON- would add possibly call the whale as some craft be
nowadays christen the shark the gull the eagle nor have there
be want learn exegetist who have opine that the whale mention
in the book of jonah merely mean a life preserver an inflated bag
of wind which the endanger prophet swim to and so be save from a
watery doom poor sag harbor therefore seem worst all round but
-PRON- have still another reason for -PRON- want of faith -PRON- be this if -PRON-
remember right jonah be swallow by the whale in the mediterranean
sea and after three day -PRON- be vomit up somewhere within three day
journey of nineveh a city on the tigris very much more than three
day journey across from the near point of the mediterranean coast
how be that

but be there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within that
short distance of nineveh yes -PRON- may have carry -PRON- round by the
way of the cape of good hope but not to speak of the passage through
the whole length of the mediterranean and another passage up the
persian gulf and red sea such a supposition would involve the complete
circumnavigation of all africa in three day not to speak of the tigris
water near the site of nineveh be too shallow for any whale to
swim in besides this idea of jonah 's weather the cape of good hope
at so early a day would wrest the honour of the discovery of that great
headland from bartholomew diaz -PRON- reputed discoverer and so make
modern history a liar

but all these foolish argument of old sag harbor only evince -PRON-
foolish pride of reason a thing still more reprehensible in -PRON- see
that -PRON- have but little learning except what -PRON- have pick up from the
sun and the sea -PRON- say -PRON- only show -PRON- foolish impious pride and
abominable devilish rebellion against the reverend clergy for by a
portuguese catholic priest this very idea of jonah be go to nineveh
via the cape of good hope be advance as a signal magnification of
the general miracle and so -PRON- be besides to this day the highly
enlightened turks devoutly believe in the historical story of jonah and
some three century ago an english traveller in old harris 's voyage
speak of a turkish mosque build in honour of jonah in which mosque be
a miraculous lamp that burn without any oil



chapter 84 pitchpol


to make -PRON- run easily and swiftly the axle of carriage be
anoint and for much the same purpose some whaler perform an
analogous operation upon -PRON- boat -PRON- grease the bottom nor be -PRON-
to be doubt that as such a procedure can do no harm -PRON- may possibly
be of no contemptible advantage consider that oil and water be
hostile that oil be a sliding thing and that the object in view be to
make the boat slide bravely queequeg believe strongly in anoint
-PRON- boat and one morning not long after the german ship jungfrau
disappear take more than customary pain in that occupation crawl
under -PRON- bottom where -PRON- hang over the side and rub in the
unctuousness as though diligently seek to insure a crop of hair from
the craft 's bald keel -PRON- seem to be work in obedience to some
particular presentiment nor do -PRON- remain unwarranted by the event

towards noon whale be raise but so soon as the ship sail down to
-PRON- -PRON- turn and flee with swift precipitancy a disordered flight
as of cleopatra 's barge from actium

nevertheless the boat pursue and stubb 's be foremost by great
exertion tashtego at last succeed in plant one iron but the
stricken whale without at all sound still continue -PRON- horizontal
flight with add fleetness such unintermitted straining upon the
plant iron must sooner or later inevitably extract -PRON- -PRON- become
imperative to lance the fly whale or be content to lose -PRON- but
to haul the boat up to -PRON- flank be impossible -PRON- swim so fast and
furious what then remain

of all the wondrous device and dexterity the sleight of hand and
countless subtlety to which the veteran whaleman be so often force
none exceed that fine manoeuvre with the lance call pitchpoling small
sword or broad sword in all -PRON- exercise boast nothing like -PRON- -PRON-
be only indispensable with an inveterate run whale -PRON- grand
fact and feature be the wonderful distance to which the long lance be
accurately dart from a violently rock jerk boat under extreme
headway steel and wood include the entire spear be some ten or twelve
foot in length the staff be much slighter than that of the harpoon
and also of a light material pine -PRON- be furnish with a small rope
call a warp of considerable length by which -PRON- can be haul back to
the hand after dart

but before go further -PRON- be important to mention here that though
the harpoon may be pitchpol in the same way with the lance yet -PRON-
be seldom do and when do be still less frequently successful
on account of the great weight and inferior length of the harpoon as
compare with the lance which in effect become serious drawback as a
general thing therefore -PRON- must first get fast to a whale before any
pitchpoling come into play

look now at stubb a man who from -PRON- humorous deliberate coolness and
equanimity in the direst emergency be specially qualified to excel
in pitchpoling look at -PRON- -PRON- stand upright in the toss bow of the
fly boat wrapt in fleecy foam the towing whale be forty foot ahead
handle the long lance lightly glance twice or thrice along -PRON-
length to see if -PRON- be exactly straight stubb whistlingly gather up
the coil of the warp in one hand so as to secure -PRON- free end in -PRON-
grasp leave the rest unobstructed then hold the lance full before
-PRON- waistband 's middle -PRON- level -PRON- at the whale when cover
-PRON- with -PRON- -PRON- steadily depress the butt end in -PRON- hand thereby
elevate the point till the weapon stand fairly balanced upon -PRON-
palm fifteen foot in the air -PRON- mind -PRON- somewhat of a juggler
balance a long staff on -PRON- chin next moment with a rapid nameless
impulse in a superb lofty arch the bright steel span the foam
distance and quiver in the life spot of the whale instead of
sparkling water -PRON- now spout red blood

that drive the spigot out of -PRON- cry stubb tis july 's immortal
fourth all fountain must run wine today would now -PRON- be old
orleans whiskey or old ohio or unspeakable old monongahela then
tashtego lad -PRON- would have ye hold a canakin to the jet and -PRON- would drink
round -PRON- yea verily heart alive -PRON- would brew choice punch in the
spread of -PRON- spout hole there and from that live punch bowl quaff the
live stuff

again and again to such gamesome talk the dexterous dart be repeat
the spear return to -PRON- master like a greyhound hold in skilful
leash the agonized whale go into -PRON- flurry the tow line be
slacken and the pitchpoler drop astern fold -PRON- hand and
mutely watch the monster die



chapter 85 the fountain


that for six thousand year and no one know how many million of age
before the great whale should have be spout all over the sea
and sprinkling and mistify the garden of the deep as with so
many sprinkling or mistify pot and that for some century back
thousand of hunter should have be close by the fountain of the
whale watch these sprinkling and spouting that all this should
be and yet that down to this blessed minute fifteen and a quarter
minute past one o'clock p.m. of this sixteenth day of december a.d.
1851 -PRON- should still remain a problem whether these spouting
be after all really water or nothing but vapour this be surely a
noteworthy thing

let -PRON- then look at this matter along with some interesting item
contingent every one know that by the peculiar cunning of -PRON-
gill the finny tribe in general breathe the air which at all time be
combine with the element in which -PRON- swim hence a herring or a cod
may live a century and never once raise -PRON- head above the surface
but owe to -PRON- marked internal structure which give -PRON- regular
lung like a human being 's the whale can only live by inhale the
disengage air in the open atmosphere wherefore the necessity for
-PRON- periodical visit to the upper world but -PRON- can not in any degree
breathe through -PRON- mouth for in -PRON- ordinary attitude the sperm
whale 's mouth be bury at least eight foot beneath the surface and
what be still more -PRON- windpipe have no connexion with -PRON- mouth no -PRON-
breathe through -PRON- spiracle alone and this be on the top of -PRON- head

if -PRON- say that in any creature breathing be only a function
indispensable to vitality inasmuch as -PRON- withdraw from the air a
certain element which be subsequently bring into contact with the
blood impart to the blood -PRON- vivify principle -PRON- do not think -PRON-
shall err though -PRON- may possibly use some superfluous scientific word
assume -PRON- and -PRON- follow that if all the blood in a man could be
aerate with one breath -PRON- may then seal up -PRON- nostril and not
fetch another for a considerable time that be to say -PRON- would then
live without breathing anomalous as -PRON- may seem this be precisely the
case with the whale who systematically live by interval -PRON- full
hour and more when at the bottom without draw a single breath or
so much as in any way inhale a particle of air for remember -PRON- have
no gill how be this between -PRON- rib and on each side of -PRON- spine
-PRON- be supply with a remarkable involved cretan labyrinth of
vermicelli like vessel which vessel when -PRON- quit the surface be
completely distend with oxygenated blood so that for an hour or more
a thousand fathom in the sea -PRON- carry a surplus stock of vitality in
-PRON- just as the camel cross the waterless desert carry a surplus
supply of drink for future use in -PRON- four supplementary stomach
the anatomical fact of this labyrinth be indisputable and that the
supposition found upon -PRON- be reasonable and true seem the more
cogent to -PRON- when -PRON- consider the otherwise inexplicable obstinacy of
that leviathan in have his spoutings out as the fisherman phrase
-PRON- this be what -PRON- mean if unmolested upon rise to the surface the
sperm whale will continue there for a period of time exactly uniform
with all -PRON- other unmolested rising say -PRON- stay eleven minute and
jet seventy time that is respire seventy breath then whenever -PRON-
rise again -PRON- will be sure to have -PRON- seventy breath over again to
a minute now if after -PRON- fetch a few breath -PRON- alarm -PRON- so that
-PRON- sound -PRON- will be always dodge up again to make good -PRON- regular
allowance of air and not till those seventy breath be tell will -PRON-
finally go down to stay out -PRON- full term below remark however that
in different individual these rate be different but in any one
-PRON- be alike now why should the whale thus insist upon have -PRON-
spouting out unless -PRON- be to replenish -PRON- reservoir of air ere
descend for good how obvious be -PRON- too that this necessity for the
whale 's rise expose -PRON- to all the fatal hazard of the chase for
not by hook or by net could this vast leviathan be catch when sail
a thousand fathom beneath the sunlight not so much thy skill then o
hunter as the great necessity that strike the victory to thee

in man breathing be incessantly go on one breath only serve
for two or three pulsation so that whatev other business -PRON- have to
attend to wake or sleep breathe -PRON- must or die -PRON- will but the
sperm whale only breathe about one seventh or sunday of -PRON- time

-PRON- have be say that the whale only breathe through -PRON- spout hole if
-PRON- could truthfully be add that -PRON- spout be mix with water then
-PRON- opine -PRON- should be furnish with the reason why -PRON- sense of smell
seem obliterate in -PRON- for the only thing about -PRON- that at all
answer to -PRON- nose be that identical spout hole and be so clogged
with two element -PRON- could not be expect to have the power of
smell but owe to the mystery of the spout whether -PRON- be water or
whether -PRON- be vapour no absolute certainty can as yet be arrive at on
this head sure -PRON- be nevertheless that the sperm whale have no proper
olfactorie but what do -PRON- want of -PRON- no rose no violet no
cologne water in the sea

furthermore as -PRON- windpipe solely open into the tube of -PRON- spout
canal and as that long canal like the grand erie canal be furnish
with a sort of lock that open and shut for the downward retention of
air or the upward exclusion of water therefore the whale have no voice
unless -PRON- insult -PRON- by say that when -PRON- so strangely rumble
-PRON- talk through -PRON- nose but then again what have the whale to say
seldom have -PRON- know any profound being that have anything to say to
this world unless force to stammer out something by way of get a
living oh happy that the world be such an excellent listener

now the spout canal of the sperm whale chiefly intend as -PRON-
be for the conveyance of air and for several foot lay along
horizontally just beneath the upper surface of -PRON- head and a little
to one side this curious canal be very much like a gas pipe lay down
in a city on one side of a street but the question return whether this
gas pipe be also a water pipe in other word whether the spout of the
sperm whale be the mere vapour of the exhaled breath or whether that
exhaled breath be mix with water take in at the mouth and
discharge through the spiracle -PRON- be certain that the mouth indirectly
communicate with the spout canal but -PRON- can not be prove that this
be for the purpose of discharge water through the spiracle because
the great necessity for so do would seem to be when in feed -PRON-
accidentally take in water but the sperm whale 's food be far beneath
the surface and there -PRON- can not spout even if -PRON- would besides if
-PRON- regard -PRON- very closely and time -PRON- with -PRON- watch -PRON- will find
that when unmolested there be an undeviat rhyme between the period
of -PRON- jet and the ordinary period of respiration

but why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject speak out
-PRON- have see -PRON- spout then declare what the spout be can -PRON- not
tell water from air -PRON- dear sir in this world -PRON- be not so easy to
settle these plain thing -PRON- have ever find -PRON- plain thing the
knottiest of all and as for this whale spout -PRON- may almost stand in
-PRON- and yet be undecided as to what -PRON- be precisely

the central body of -PRON- be hide in the snowy sparkling mist envelop
-PRON- and how can -PRON- certainly tell whether any water fall from -PRON-
when always when -PRON- be close enough to a whale to get a close view
of -PRON- spout -PRON- be in a prodigious commotion the water cascade
all around -PRON- and if at such time -PRON- should think that -PRON- really
perceive drop of moisture in the spout how do -PRON- know that -PRON- be
not merely condense from -PRON- vapour or how do -PRON- know that -PRON-
be not those identical drop superficially lodge in the spout hole
fissure which be countersunk into the summit of the whale 's head for
even when tranquilly swim through the mid day sea in a calm with
-PRON- elevated hump sun dry as a dromedary 's in the desert even then
the whale always carry a small basin of water on -PRON- head as under
a blaze sun -PRON- will sometimes see a cavity in a rock fill up with
rain

nor be -PRON- at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touch the
precise nature of the whale spout -PRON- will not do for -PRON- to be peer
into -PRON- and put -PRON- face in -PRON- -PRON- can not go with -PRON- pitcher to
this fountain and fill -PRON- and bring -PRON- away for even when come into
slight contact with the outer vapoury shred of the jet which will
often happen -PRON- skin will feverishly smart from the acridness of
the thing so touch -PRON- and -PRON- know one who come into still close
contact with the spout whether with some scientific object in view
or otherwise -PRON- can not say the skin peel off from -PRON- cheek and arm
wherefore among whaleman the spout be deem poisonous -PRON- try to
evade -PRON- another thing -PRON- have hear -PRON- say and -PRON- do not much doubt
-PRON- that if the jet be fairly spout into -PRON- eye -PRON- will blind -PRON-
the wise thing the investigator can do then -PRON- seem to -PRON- be to let
this deadly spout alone

still -PRON- can hypothesize even if -PRON- can not prove and establish -PRON-
hypothesis be this that the spout be nothing but mist and besides
other reason to this conclusion -PRON- be impel by consideration
touch the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the sperm whale
-PRON- account -PRON- no common shallow being inasmuch as -PRON- be an undisputed
fact that -PRON- be never find on sounding or near shore all other
whale sometimes be -PRON- be both ponderous and profound and -PRON- be
convince that from the head of all ponderous profound being such as
plato pyrrho the devil jupiter dante and so on there always go
up a certain semi visible steam while in the act of think deep
thought while compose a little treatise on eternity -PRON- have the
curiosity to place a mirror before -PRON- and ere long saw reflect there
a curious involved worming and undulation in the atmosphere over -PRON-
head the invariable moisture of -PRON- hair while plunge in deep thought
after six cup of hot tea in -PRON- thin shingled attic of an august noon
this seem an additional argument for the above supposition

and how nobly -PRON- raise -PRON- conceit of the mighty misty monster to
behold -PRON- solemnly sail through a calm tropical sea -PRON- vast mild
head overhang by a canopy of vapour engender by -PRON- incommunicable
contemplation and that vapour as -PRON- will sometimes see -PRON- glorify
by a rainbow as if heaven -PRON- have put -PRON- seal upon -PRON- thought
for d'ye see rainbow do not visit the clear air -PRON- only irradiate
vapour and so through all the thick mist of the dim doubt in -PRON-
mind divine intuition now and then shoot enkindle -PRON- fog with a
heavenly ray and for this -PRON- thank god for all have doubt many deny
but doubt or denial few along with -PRON- have intuition doubt
of all thing earthly and intuition of some thing heavenly this
combination make neither believer nor infidel but make a man who
regard -PRON- both with equal eye



chapter 86 the tail


other poet have warble the praise of the soft eye of the antelope
and the lovely plumage of the bird that never alight less celestial -PRON-
celebrate a tail

reckon the large sized sperm whale 's tail to begin at that point of
the trunk where -PRON- taper to about the girth of a man -PRON- comprise
upon -PRON- upper surface alone an area of at least fifty square foot the
compact round body of -PRON- root expand into two broad firm flat palm
or fluke gradually shoal away to less than an inch in thickness
at the crotch or junction these fluke slightly overlap then sideways
recede from each other like wing leave a wide vacancy between in
no living thing be the line of beauty more exquisitely define than in
the crescentic border of these fluke at -PRON- utmost expansion in the
full grown whale the tail will considerably exceed twenty foot across

the entire member seem a dense webbed bed of weld sinew but cut
into -PRON- and -PRON- find that three distinct stratum compose -PRON- upper
middle and low the fibre in the upper and lower layer be
long and horizontal those of the middle one very short and run
crosswise between the outside layer this triune structure as much as
anything else impart power to the tail to the student of old roman
wall the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the thin
course of tile always alternate with the stone in those wonderful
relic of the antique and which undoubtedly contribute so much to the
great strength of the masonry

but as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail be not enough
the whole bulk of the leviathan be knit over with a warp and woof of
muscular fibre and filament which pass on either side the loin
and run down into the fluke insensibly blend with -PRON- and
largely contribute to -PRON- might so that in the tail the confluent
measureless force of the whole whale seem concentrated to a point
could annihilation occur to matter this be the thing to do -PRON-

nor do this -PRON- amazing strength at all tend to cripple the graceful
flexion of -PRON- motion where infantileness of ease undulate through
a titanism of power on the contrary those motion derive -PRON- most
appal beauty from -PRON- real strength never impair beauty or harmony
but -PRON- often bestow -PRON- and in everything imposingly beautiful
strength have much to do with the magic take away the tie tendon that
all over seem burst from the marble in the carve hercules and -PRON-
charm would be go as devout eckerman lift the linen sheet from the
naked corpse of goethe -PRON- be overwhelmed with the massive chest of the
man that seem as a roman triumphal arch when angelo paint even god
the father in human form mark what robustness be there and whatev
-PRON- may reveal of the divine love in the son the soft curl
hermaphroditical italian picture in which -PRON- idea have be most
successfully embody these picture so destitute as -PRON- be of all
brawniness hint nothing of any power but the mere negative feminine
one of submission and endurance which on all hand -PRON- be concede form
the peculiar practical virtue of -PRON- teaching

such be the subtle elasticity of the organ -PRON- treat of that whether
wield in sport or in earnest or in anger whatev be the mood -PRON-
be in -PRON- flexion be invariably mark by exceed grace therein no
fairy 's arm can transcend -PRON-

five great motion be peculiar to -PRON- first when use as a fin for
progression second when use as a mace in battle third in sweeping
fourth in lobtailing fifth in peak fluke

first be horizontal in -PRON- position the leviathan 's tail act in
a different manner from the tail of all other sea creature -PRON- never
wriggle in man or fish wriggle be a sign of inferiority to the
whale -PRON- tail be the sole mean of propulsion scroll wise coiled
forward beneath the body and then rapidly spring backwards -PRON- be this
which give that singular darting leap motion to the monster when
furiously swimming -PRON- side fin only serve to steer by

second -PRON- be a little significant that while one sperm whale only
fight another sperm whale with -PRON- head and jaw nevertheless in -PRON-
conflict with man -PRON- chiefly and contemptuously use -PRON- tail in
strike at a boat -PRON- swiftly curve away -PRON- fluke from -PRON- and the
blow be only inflict by the recoil if -PRON- be make in the unobstructed
air especially if -PRON- descend to -PRON- mark the stroke be then simply
irresistible no rib of man or boat can withstand -PRON- -PRON- only
salvation lie in elude -PRON- but if -PRON- come sideways through the
oppose water then partly owe to the light buoyancy of the whale
boat and the elasticity of -PRON- material a crack rib or a dash
plank or two a sort of stitch in the side be generally the most
serious result these submerge side blow be so often receive in the
fishery that -PRON- be account mere child 's play some one strip off
a frock and the hole be stop

third -PRON- can not demonstrate -PRON- but -PRON- seem to -PRON- that in the whale
the sense of touch be concentrate in the tail for in this respect
there be a delicacy in -PRON- only equal by the daintiness of the
elephant 's trunk this delicacy be chiefly evince in the action of
sweeping when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft
slowness move -PRON- immense fluke from side to side upon the surface
of the sea and if -PRON- feel but a sailor 's whisker woe to that sailor
whisker and all what tenderness there be in that preliminary touch
have this tail any prehensile power -PRON- should straightway bethink -PRON- of
darmonodes elephant that so frequent the flower market and with
low salutation present nosegay to damsel and then caress -PRON-
zone on more account than one a pity -PRON- be that the whale do not
possess this prehensile virtue in -PRON- tail for -PRON- have hear of yet
another elephant that when wound in the fight curved round -PRON- trunk
and extract the dart

fourth steal unawar upon the whale in the fancy security of the
middle of solitary sea -PRON- find -PRON- unbent from the vast corpulence
of -PRON- dignity and kitten like -PRON- play on the ocean as if -PRON- be a
hearth but still -PRON- see -PRON- power in -PRON- play the broad palm of
-PRON- tail be flirt high into the air then smite the surface the
thunderous concussion resound for mile -PRON- would almost think a great
gun have be discharge and if -PRON- notice the light wreath of vapour
from the spiracle at -PRON- other extremity -PRON- would think that that be
the smoke from the touch hole

fifth as in the ordinary float posture of the leviathan the fluke
lie considerably below the level of -PRON- back -PRON- be then completely
out of sight beneath the surface but when -PRON- be about to plunge into
the deep -PRON- entire fluke with at least thirty foot of -PRON- body be
toss erect in the air and so remain vibrate a moment till -PRON-
downwards shoot out of view except the sublime breach somewhere
else to be describe this peaking of the whale 's fluke be perhaps the
grand sight to be see in all animated nature out of the bottomless
profundity the gigantic tail seem spasmodically snatch at the
high heaven so in dream have -PRON- see majestic satan thrust forth
-PRON- tormented colossal claw from the flame baltic of hell but in
gaze at such scene -PRON- be all in all what mood -PRON- be in if in
the dantean the devil will occur to -PRON- if in that of isaiah the
archangel stand at the mast head of -PRON- ship during a sunrise that
crimson sky and sea -PRON- once see a large herd of whale in the east
all head towards the sun and for a moment vibrate in concert with
peak fluke as -PRON- seem to -PRON- at the time such a grand embodiment
of adoration of the god be never behold even in persia the home of
the fire worshipper as ptolemy philopater testify of the african
elephant -PRON- then testify of the whale pronounce -PRON- the most devout
of all being for accord to king juba the military elephant of
antiquity often hail the morning with -PRON- trunk uplift in the
profound silence

the chance comparison in this chapter between the whale and the
elephant so far as some aspect of the tail of the one and the trunk
of the other be concern should not tend to place those two
opposite organ on an equality much less the creature to which -PRON-
respectively belong for as the mighty elephant be but a terrier
to leviathan so compare with leviathan 's tail -PRON- trunk be but the
stalk of a lily the most direful blow from the elephant 's trunk be as
the playful tap of a fan compare with the measureless crush and crash
of the sperm whale 's ponderous fluke which in repeat instance have
one after the other hurl entire boat with all -PRON- oar and crew
into the air very much as an indian juggler toss -PRON- ball


though all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whale
and the elephant be preposterous inasmuch as in that particular the
elephant stand in much the same respect to the whale that a dog do to
the elephant nevertheless there be not want some point of curious
similitude among these be the spout -PRON- be well know that the elephant
will often draw up water or dust in -PRON- trunk and then elevate -PRON-
jet -PRON- forth in a stream


the more -PRON- consider this mighty tail the more do -PRON- deplore -PRON- inability
to express -PRON- at time there be gesture in -PRON- which though -PRON-
would well grace the hand of man remain wholly inexplicable in an
extensive herd so remarkable occasionally be these mystic gesture
that -PRON- have hear hunter who have declare -PRON- akin to free mason
sign and symbol that the whale indeed by these method
intelligently converse with the world nor be there want other
motion of the whale in -PRON- general body full of strangeness and
unaccountable to -PRON- most experienced assailant dissect -PRON- how -PRON- may
then -PRON- but go skin deep -PRON- know -PRON- not and never will but if -PRON- know
not even the tail of this whale how understand -PRON- head much more
how comprehend -PRON- face when face -PRON- have none thou shalt see -PRON- back
part -PRON- tail -PRON- seem to say but -PRON- face shall not be see but -PRON-
can not completely make out -PRON- back part and hint what -PRON- will about
-PRON- face -PRON- say again -PRON- have no face



chapter 87 the grand armada


the long and narrow peninsula of malacca extend south eastward from
the territory of birmah form the most southerly point of all asia
in a continuous line from that peninsula stretch the long island of
sumatra java bally and timor which with many other form a
vast mole or rampart lengthwise connect asia with australia
and divide the long unbroken indian ocean from the thickly studded
oriental archipelago this rampart be pierce by several sally port
for the convenience of ship and whale conspicuous among which be the
strait of sunda and malacca by the strait of sunda chiefly vessel
bind to china from the west emerge into the china sea

those narrow strait of sunda divide sumatra from java and stand
midway in that vast rampart of island buttress by that bold green
promontory know to seaman as java head -PRON- not a little correspond
to the central gateway opening into some vast walled empire and
consider the inexhaustible wealth of spice and silk and jewel
and gold and ivory with which the thousand island of that oriental
sea be enrich -PRON- seem a significant provision of nature that such
treasure by the very formation of the land should at least bear the
appearance however ineffectual of be guard from the all grasp
western world the shore of the straits of sunda be unsupplied
with those domineer fortress which guard the entrance to the
mediterranean the baltic and the propontis unlike the danes these
oriental do not demand the obsequious homage of lower top sail from
the endless procession of ship before the wind which for century
past by night and by day have pass between the island of sumatra
and java freight with the costly cargo of the east but while
-PRON- freely waive a ceremonial like this -PRON- do by no mean renounce
-PRON- claim to more solid tribute

time out of mind the piratical proas of the malays lurk among
the low shaded cove and islet of sumatra have sally out upon the
vessel sail through the strait fiercely demand tribute at the
point of -PRON- spear though by the repeat bloody chastisement -PRON-
have receive at the hand of european cruiser the audacity of these
corsair have of late be somewhat repressed yet even at the present
day -PRON- occasionally hear of english and american vessel which in
those water have be remorselessly board and pillage

with a fair fresh wind the pequod be now draw nigh to these
strait ahab purpose to pass through -PRON- into the javan sea and
thence cruise northward over water know to be frequent here and
there by the sperm whale sweep inshore by the philippine islands and
gain the far coast of japan in time for the great whaling season there
by these mean the circumnavigating pequod would sweep almost all the
know sperm whale cruise ground of the world previous to descend
upon the line in the pacific where ahab though everywhere else foil
in -PRON- pursuit firmly count upon give battle to moby dick in the
sea -PRON- be most know to frequent and at a season when -PRON- may most
reasonably be presume to be haunt -PRON-

but how now in this zone quest do ahab touch no land do -PRON- crew
drink air surely -PRON- will stop for water nay for a long time now
the circus run sun have race within -PRON- fiery ring and need
no sustenance but what be in -PRON- so ahab mark this too in the
whaler while other hull be load down with alien stuff to be
transfer to foreign wharf the world wander whale ship carry
no cargo but -PRON- and crew -PRON- weapon and -PRON- want -PRON- have a
whole lake 's content bottle in -PRON- ample hold -PRON- be ballast with
utility not altogether with unusable pig lead and kentledge -PRON-
carry year water in -PRON- clear old prime nantucket water which
when three year afloat the nantucketer in the pacific prefer to
drink before the brackish fluid but yesterday raft off in cask from
the peruvian or indian stream hence -PRON- be that while other ship may
have go to china from new york and back again touch at a score
of port the whale ship in all that interval may not have sight
one grain of soil -PRON- crew have see no man but float seaman like
-PRON- so that do -PRON- carry -PRON- the news that another flood have
come -PRON- would only answer--"well boy here be the ark

now as many sperm whales have be capture off the western coast of
java in the near vicinity of the straits of sunda indeed as most of
the ground roundabout be generally recognise by the fisherman as an
excellent spot for cruise therefore as the pequod gain more
and more upon java head the look out be repeatedly hail and
admonish to keep wide awake but though the green palmy cliff of the
land soon loom on the starboard bow and with delighted nostril
the fresh cinnamon be snuff in the air yet not a single jet be
descry almost renounce all thought of fall in with any game
hereabout the ship have well nigh enter the strait when the
customary cheering cry be hear from aloft and ere long a spectacle of
singular magnificence salute -PRON-

but here be -PRON- premise that owe to the unwearied activity with which
of late -PRON- have be hunt over all four ocean the sperm whales
instead of almost invariably sail in small detached company as in
former time be now frequently meet with in extensive herd sometimes
embrace so great a multitude that -PRON- would almost seem as if
numerous nation of -PRON- have swear solemn league and covenant for mutual
assistance and protection to this aggregation of the sperm whale into
such immense caravan may be impute the circumstance that even in the
good cruise ground -PRON- may now sometimes sail for week and month
together without be greet by a single spout and then be suddenly
salute by what sometimes seem thousand on thousand

broad on both bow at the distance of some two or three mile and
form a great semicircle embrace one half of the level horizon
a continuous chain of whale jet be up play and sparkle in the
noon day air unlike the straight perpendicular twin jet of the right
whale which divide at top fall over in two branch like the cleft
droop bough of a willow the single forward slant spout of the
sperm whale present a thick curl bush of white mist continually
rise and fall away to leeward

see from the pequod 's deck then as -PRON- would rise on a high hill of
the sea this host of vapoury spout individually curl up into the
air and behold through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze show
like the thousand cheerful chimney of some dense metropolis descry
of a balmy autumnal morning by some horseman on a height

as march army approach an unfriendly defile in the mountain
accelerate -PRON- march all eagerness to place that perilous passage in
-PRON- rear and once more expand in comparative security upon the plain
even so do this vast fleet of whale now seem hurry forward through
the strait gradually contract the wing of -PRON- semicircle and
swimming on in one solid but still crescentic centre

crowd all sail the pequod press after -PRON- the harpooneer
handle -PRON- weapon and loudly cheer from the head of -PRON-
yet suspend boat if the wind only hold little doubt have -PRON- that
chase through these strait of sunda the vast host would only deploy
into the oriental sea to witness the capture of not a few of -PRON-
number and who could tell whether in that congregate caravan moby
dick -PRON- may not temporarily be swim like the worship
white elephant in the coronation procession of the siamese so with
stun sail pile on stun sail -PRON- sail along drive these leviathan
before -PRON- when of a sudden the voice of tashtego be hear loudly
direct attention to something in -PRON- wake

correspond to the crescent in -PRON- van -PRON- behold another in -PRON- rear
-PRON- seem form of detach white vapour rise and fall something
like the spout of the whale only -PRON- do not so completely come and
go for -PRON- constantly hover without finally disappear level
-PRON- glass at this sight ahab quickly revolve in -PRON- pivot hole
cry aloft there and rig whip and bucket to wet the
sail malays sir and after -PRON-

as if too long lurk behind the headland till the pequod should
fairly have enter the strait these rascally asiatics be now in hot
pursuit to make up for -PRON- over cautious delay but when the swift
pequod with a fresh leading wind be -PRON- in hot chase how very
kind of these tawny philanthropist to assist in speed -PRON- on to
-PRON- own choose pursuit mere riding whip and rowel to -PRON- that -PRON-
be as with glass under arm ahab to and fro pace the deck in -PRON-
forward turn behold the monster -PRON- chase and in the after one the
bloodthirsty pirate chase -PRON- some such fancy as the above seem
-PRON- and when -PRON- glance upon the green wall of the watery defile in
which the ship be then sail and bethink -PRON- that through that
gate lie the route to -PRON- vengeance and beheld how that through that
same gate -PRON- be now both chase and be chase to -PRON- deadly end
and not only that but a herd of remorseless wild pirate and
inhuman atheistical devil be infernally cheer -PRON- on with -PRON-
curse when all these conceit have pass through -PRON- brain ahab 's
brow be leave gaunt and ribbed like the black sand beach after some
stormy tide have be gnaw -PRON- without be able to drag the firm
thing from -PRON- place

but thought like these trouble very few of the reckless crew and
when after steadily drop and drop the pirate astern the
pequod at last shot by the vivid green cockatoo point on the sumatra
side emerge at last upon the broad water beyond then the
harpooneer seem more to grieve that the swift whale have be gain
upon the ship than to rejoice that the ship have so victoriously gain
upon the malays but still drive on in the wake of the whale at
length -PRON- seem abate -PRON- speed gradually the ship near -PRON-
and the wind now die away word be pass to spring to the boat but
no sooner do the herd by some presume wonderful instinct of the sperm
whale become notify of the three keel that be after -PRON- though
as yet a mile in -PRON- rear than -PRON- rally again and form
in close rank and battalion so that -PRON- spout all look like
flash line of stack bayonet move on with redouble velocity

strip to -PRON- shirt and drawer -PRON- spring to the white ash and
after several hour pull be almost disposed to renounce the chase
when a general pause commotion among the whale give animate
token that -PRON- be now at last under the influence of that strange
perplexity of inert irresolution which when the fisherman perceive
-PRON- in the whale -PRON- say -PRON- be galli the compact martial column
in which -PRON- have be hitherto rapidly and steadily swimming be now
break up in one measureless rout and like king porus elephant in the
indian battle with alexander -PRON- seem go mad with consternation
in all direction expand in vast irregular circle and aimlessly
swim hither and thither by -PRON- short thick spouting -PRON-
plainly betray -PRON- distraction of panic this be still more
strangely evince by those of -PRON- number who completely paralysed
as -PRON- be helplessly float like water log dismantled ship on the
sea have these leviathans be but a flock of simple sheep pursue over
the pasture by three fierce wolf -PRON- could not possibly have evince
such excessive dismay but this occasional timidity be characteristic
of almost all herd creature though band together in ten of
thousand the lion man buffalo of the west have flee before a
solitary horseman witness too all human being how when herd
together in the sheepfold of a theatre 's pit -PRON- will at the
slight alarm of fire rush helter skelter for the outlet crowd
trample jam and remorselessly dash each other to death good
therefore withhold any amazement at the strangely galli whale
before -PRON- for there be no folly of the beast of the earth which be not
infinitely outdo by the madness of man

though many of the whale as have be say be in violent motion
yet -PRON- be to be observe that as a whole the herd neither advanced nor
retreat but collectively remain in one place as be customary in
those case the boat at once separate each make for some one
lone whale on the outskirt of the shoal in about three minute time
queequeg 's harpoon be flung the stricken fish dart blind spray
in -PRON- face and then run away with -PRON- like light steer straight
for the heart of the herd though such a movement on the part of the
whale strike under such circumstance be in no wise unprecedented and
indeed be almost always more or less anticipate yet do -PRON- present
one of the more perilous vicissitude of the fishery for as the swift
monster drag -PRON- deep and deep into the frantic shoal -PRON- bid
adieu to circumspect life and only exist in a delirious throb

as blind and deaf the whale plunge forward as if by sheer power of
speed to rid -PRON- of the iron leech that have fasten to -PRON- as -PRON-
thus tear a white gash in the sea on all side menace as -PRON- fly by
the crazed creature to and fro rush about -PRON- -PRON- beset boat be
like a ship mob by ice isle in a tempest and strive to steer
through -PRON- complicated channel and strait know not at what
moment -PRON- may be lock in and crush

but not a bit daunted queequeg steer -PRON- manfully now sheer off
from this monster directly across -PRON- route in advance now edge away
from that whose colossal fluke be suspend overhead while all the
time starbuck stand up in the bow lance in hand prick out of -PRON-
way whatev whale -PRON- could reach by short dart for there be no time
to make long one nor be the oarsman quite idle though -PRON- wont
duty be now altogether dispense with -PRON- chiefly attend to the
shout part of the business out of the way commodore cry one
to a great dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface
and for an instant threaten to swamp -PRON- hard down with -PRON- tail
there cry a second to another which close to -PRON- gunwale seem
calmly cool -PRON- with -PRON- own fan like extremity

all whaleboat carry certain curious contrivance originally invent
by the nantucket indians call druggs two thick square of wood
of equal size be stoutly clenched together so that -PRON- cros each
other 's grain at right angle a line of considerable length be then
attach to the middle of this block and the other end of the line
be looped -PRON- can in a moment be fasten to a harpoon -PRON- be chiefly
among gallied whale that this drugg be use for then more whale
be close round -PRON- than -PRON- can possibly chase at one time but sperm
whale be not every day encounter while -PRON- may then -PRON- must
kill all -PRON- can and if -PRON- can not kill -PRON- all at once -PRON- must wing
-PRON- so that -PRON- can be afterwards kill at -PRON- leisure hence -PRON-
be that at time like these the drugg come into requisition -PRON- boat
be furnish with three of -PRON- the first and second be successfully
dart and -PRON- see the whale staggeringly run off fetter by the
enormous sidelong resistance of the towing drugg -PRON- be cramp like
malefactor with the chain and ball but upon fling the third in the
act of toss overboard the clumsy wooden block -PRON- catch under one
of the seat of the boat and in an instant tear -PRON- out and carry -PRON-
away drop the oarsman in the boat 's bottom as the seat slide from
under -PRON- on both side the sea come in at the wounded plank but -PRON-
stuffed two or three drawer and shirt in and so stop the leak for
the time

-PRON- have be next to impossible to dart these drug harpoon be
-PRON- not that as -PRON- advance into the herd -PRON- whale 's way greatly
diminish moreover that as -PRON- go still further and further from the
circumference of commotion the direful disorder seem wan so that
when at last the jerk harpoon draw out and the towing whale sideways
vanish then with the taper force of -PRON- parting momentum -PRON-
glide between two whale into the innermost heart of the shoal as if
from some mountain torrent -PRON- have slide into a serene valley lake here
the storm in the roar glen between the outermost whale be hear
but not feel in this central expanse the sea present that smooth
satin like surface call a sleek produce by the subtle moisture
throw off by the whale in -PRON- more quiet mood yes -PRON- be now
in that enchanted calm which -PRON- say lurk at the heart of every
commotion and still in the distracted distance -PRON- behold the tumult of
the outer concentric circle and see successive pod of whale eight
or ten in each swiftly go round and round like multiply span of
horse in a ring and so closely shoulder to shoulder that a titanic
circus rider may easily have over arch the middle one and so have
go round on -PRON- back owe to the density of the crowd of repose
whale more immediately surround the embayed axis of the herd no
possible chance of escape be at present afford -PRON- -PRON- must watch for
a breach in the living wall that hem -PRON- in the wall that have only
admit -PRON- in order to shut -PRON- up keep at the centre of the lake
-PRON- be occasionally visit by small tame cow and calf the woman
and child of this rout host

now inclusive of the occasional wide interval between the revolve
outer circle and inclusive of the space between the various pod in
any one of those circle the entire area at this juncture embrace by
the whole multitude must have contain at least two or three square
mile at any rate though indeed such a test at such a time may be
deceptive spouting may be discover from -PRON- low boat that
seem play up almost from the rim of the horizon -PRON- mention this
circumstance because as if the cow and calf have be purposely
lock up in this innermost fold and as if the wide extent of the
herd have hitherto prevent -PRON- from learn the precise cause of -PRON-
stop or possibly be so young unsophisticated and every way
innocent and inexperienced however -PRON- may have be these small
whale now and then visit -PRON- becalm boat from the margin of the
lake evince a wondrous fearlessness and confidence or else a still
becharm panic which -PRON- be impossible not to marvel at like household
dog -PRON- come snuffle round -PRON- right up to -PRON- gunwale and
touch -PRON- till -PRON- almost seem that some spell have suddenly
domesticate -PRON- queequeg pat -PRON- forehead starbuck scratch
-PRON- back with -PRON- lance but fearful of the consequence for the
time refrain from dart -PRON-

but far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface another and still
strange world meet -PRON- eye as -PRON- gaze over the side for suspend
in those watery vault float the form of the nursing mother of the
whale and those that by -PRON- enormous girth seem shortly to
become mother the lake as -PRON- have hint be to a considerable depth
exceedingly transparent and as human infant while suckle will calmly
and fixedly gaze away from the breast as if lead two different
life at the time and while yet draw mortal nourishment be still
spiritually feast upon some unearthly reminiscence even so do the
young of these whale seem look up towards -PRON- but not at -PRON- as if
-PRON- be but a bit of gulfweed in -PRON- new bear sight float on -PRON-
side the mother also seem quietly eye -PRON- one of these little
infant that from certain queer token seem hardly a day old may
have measure some fourteen foot in length and some six foot in
girth -PRON- be a little frisky though as yet -PRON- body seem scarce yet
recover from that irksome position -PRON- have so lately occupy in the
maternal reticule where tail to head and all ready for the final
spring the unborn whale lie bent like a tartar 's bow the delicate
side fin and the palm of -PRON- fluke still freshly retain the
plait crumpled appearance of a baby 's ear newly arrive from foreign
part

line line cry queequeg look over the gunwale -PRON- fast -PRON-
fast!--who line -PRON- who strike two whale one big one little

what ail ye man cry starbuck

look e here say queequeg point down

as when the stricken whale that from the tub have reel out hundred of
fathom of rope as after deep sounding -PRON- float up again and show
the slackened curling line buoyantly rise and spiral towards the
air so now starbuck see long coil of the umbilical cord of madame
leviathan by which the young cub seem still tethered to -PRON- dam not
seldom in the rapid vicissitude of the chase this natural line with
the maternal end loose become entangled with the hempen one so that
the cub be thereby trap some of the subtle secret of the sea
seem divulge to -PRON- in this enchanted pond -PRON- see young leviathan
amour in the deep


the sperm whale as with all other specie of the leviathan but unlike
most other fish breed indifferently at all season after a gestation
which may probably be set down at nine month produce but one at a
time though in some few know instance give birth to an esau and
jacob a contingency provide for in suckling by two teat curiously
situate one on each side of the anus but the breast -PRON-
extend upwards from that when by chance these precious part in a
nursing whale be cut by the hunter 's lance the mother 's pour milk
and blood rivallingly discolour the sea for rod the milk be very sweet
and rich -PRON- have be taste by man -PRON- may do well with strawberry
when overflow with mutual esteem the whale salute more hominum


and thus though surround by circle upon circle of consternation
and affright do these inscrutable creature at the centre freely and
fearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernment yea serenely revel
in dalliance and delight but even so amid the tornadoed atlantic of
-PRON- being do -PRON- -PRON- still for ever centrally disport in mute calm and
while ponderous planet of unwan woe revolve round -PRON- deep down and
deep inland there -PRON- still bathe -PRON- in eternal mildness of joy

meanwhile as -PRON- thus lie entranced the occasional sudden frantic
spectacle in the distance evince the activity of the other boat
still engage in drug the whale on the frontier of the host or
possibly carry on the war within the first circle where abundance of
room and some convenient retreat be afford -PRON- but the sight
of the enrage drug whale now and then blindly dart to and fro
across the circle be nothing to what at last meet -PRON- eye -PRON- be
sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly powerful
and alert to seek to hamstring -PRON- as -PRON- be by sunder or
maim -PRON- gigantic tail tendon -PRON- be do by dart a short handle
cut spade to which be attach a rope for haul -PRON- back again
a whale wound as -PRON- afterwards learn in this part but not
effectually as -PRON- seem have break away from the boat carry along
with -PRON- half of the harpoon line and in the extraordinary agony of
the wound -PRON- be now dash among the revolving circle like the lone
mount desperado arnold at the battle of saratoga carry dismay
wherever -PRON- go

but agonizing as be the wound of this whale and an appalling spectacle
enough any way yet the peculiar horror with which -PRON- seem to
inspire the rest of the herd be owe to a cause which at first the
intervene distance obscure from -PRON- but at length -PRON- perceive that
by one of the unimaginable accident of the fishery this whale have
become entangled in the harpoon line that -PRON- tow -PRON- have also run
away with the cutting spade in -PRON- and while the free end of the rope
attach to that weapon have permanently catch in the coil of the
harpoon line round -PRON- tail the cutting spade -PRON- have work loose
from -PRON- flesh so that torment to madness -PRON- be now churn
through the water violently flail with -PRON- flexible tail and
toss the keen spade about -PRON- wound and murder -PRON- own
comrade

this terrific object seem to recall the whole herd from -PRON-
stationary fright first the whale form the margin of -PRON- lake
begin to crowd a little and tumble against each other as if lift
by half spend billow from afar then the lake -PRON- begin faintly to
heave and swell the submarine bridal chamber and nursery vanish
in more and more contracting orbit the whale in the more central
circle begin to swim in thickening cluster yes the long calm be
depart a low advance hum be soon hear and then like to the
tumultuous mass of block ice when the great river hudson break up in
spring the entire host of whale come tumble upon -PRON- inner centre
as if to pile -PRON- up in one common mountain instantly starbuck
and queequeg change place starbuck take the stern

oar oar -PRON- intensely whisper seize the helm--"gripe -PRON-
oar and clutch -PRON- soul now -PRON- god man stand by shove -PRON- off
-PRON- queequeg the whale there!--prick him!--hit -PRON- stand up stand
up and stay so spring man pull man never mind -PRON- back scrape
them!--scrape away

the boat be now all but jam between two vast black bulk leave a
narrow dardanelle between -PRON- long length but by desperate endeavor
-PRON- at last shot into a temporary opening then give way rapidly
and at the same time earnestly watch for another outlet after many
similar hair breadth escape -PRON- at last swiftly glide into what have
just be one of the outer circle but now cross by random whale
all violently make for one centre this lucky salvation be cheaply
purchase by the loss of queequeg 's hat who while stand in the bow
to prick the fugitive whale have -PRON- hat take clean from -PRON- head by
the air eddy make by the sudden tossing of a pair of broad fluke close
by

riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now be -PRON- soon
resolve -PRON- into what seem a systematic movement for have
clump together at last in one dense body -PRON- then renew -PRON-
onward flight with augment fleetness further pursuit be useless but
the boat still linger in -PRON- wake to pick up what drug whale
may be drop astern and likewise to secure one which flask have
kill and waif the waif be a pennoned pole two or three of which
be carry by every boat and which when additional game be at hand
be insert upright into the float body of a dead whale both to
mark -PRON- place on the sea and also as token of prior possession should
the boat of any other ship draw near

the result of this lower be somewhat illustrative of that sagacious
say in the fishery the more whale the less fish of all the
drug whale only one be capture the rest contrive to escape for
the time but only to be take as will hereafter be see by some other
craft than the pequod



chapter 88 school and schoolmasters


the previous chapter give account of an immense body or herd of sperm
whale and there be also then give the probable cause induce those
vast aggregation

now though such great body be at time encounter yet as must
have be see even at the present day small detached band be
occasionally observe embrace from twenty to fifty individual each
such band be know as school -PRON- generally be of two sort those
compose almost entirely of female and those muster none but young
vigorous male or bull as -PRON- be familiarly designate

in cavalier attendance upon the school of female -PRON- invariably see a
male of full grown magnitude but not old who upon any alarm evince
-PRON- gallantry by fall in the rear and cover the flight of -PRON-
lady in truth this gentleman be a luxurious ottoman swimming about
over the watery world surroundingly accompany by all the solace
and endearment of the harem the contrast between this ottoman and
-PRON- concubine be striking because while -PRON- be always of the large
leviathanic proportion the lady even at full growth be not
more than one third of the bulk of an average sized male -PRON- be
comparatively delicate indeed -PRON- dare say not to exceed half a dozen
yard round the waist nevertheless -PRON- can not be deny that upon the
whole -PRON- be hereditarily entitle to embonpoint

-PRON- be very curious to watch this harem and -PRON- lord in -PRON- indolent
rambling like fashionable -PRON- be for ever on the move in leisurely
search of variety -PRON- meet -PRON- on the line in time for the full flower
of the equatorial feed season have just return perhaps from
spend the summer in the northern sea and so cheat summer of all
unpleasant weariness and warmth by the time -PRON- have lounge up and
down the promenade of the equator awhile -PRON- start for the oriental
water in anticipation of the cool season there and so evade the other
excessive temperature of the year

when serenely advance on one of these journey if any strange
suspicious sight be see -PRON- lord whale keep a wary eye on -PRON-
interesting family should any unwarrantably pert young leviathan come
that way presume to draw confidentially close to one of the lady
with what prodigious fury the bashaw assail -PRON- and chase -PRON- away
high time indeed if unprincipled young rake like -PRON- be to be
permit to invade the sanctity of domestic bliss though do what the
bashaw will -PRON- can not keep the most notorious lothario out of -PRON- bed
for alas all fish bed in common as ashore the lady often cause the
most terrible duel among -PRON- rival admirer just so with the whale
who sometimes come to deadly battle and all for love -PRON- fence with
-PRON- long low jaws sometimes lock -PRON- together and so striving
for the supremacy like elk that warringly interweave -PRON- antler not
a few be capture have the deep scar of these encounter furrowed
head broken tooth scollop fin and in some instance wrench and
dislocated mouth

but suppose the invader of domestic bliss to betake -PRON- away at
the first rush of the harem 's lord then be -PRON- very diverting to watch
that lord gently -PRON- insinuate -PRON- vast bulk among -PRON- again and
revel there awhile still in tantalizing vicinity to young lothario
like pious solomon devoutly worship among -PRON- thousand concubine
grant other whale to be in sight the fisherman will seldom give
chase to one of these grand turks for these grand turks be too lavish
of -PRON- strength and hence -PRON- unctuousness be small as for the
son and the daughter -PRON- beget why those son and daughter must
take care of -PRON- at least with only the maternal help for
like certain other omnivorous rove lover that may be name -PRON- lord
whale have no taste for the nursery however much for the bower and so
be a great traveller -PRON- leave -PRON- anonymous baby all over the
world every baby an exotic in good time nevertheless as the ardour
of youth decline as year and dump increase as reflection lend
-PRON- solemn pause in short as a general lassitude overtake the sate
turk then a love of ease and virtue supplant the love for maiden -PRON-
ottoman enter upon the impotent repentant admonitory stage of life
forswear disband the harem and grow to an exemplary sulky old
soul go about all alone among the meridian and parallel say -PRON-
prayer and warn each young leviathan from -PRON- amorous error

now as the harem of whale be call by the fisherman a school so
be the lord and master of that school technically know as the
schoolmaster -PRON- be therefore not in strict character however admirably
satirical that after go to school -PRON- -PRON- should then go abroad
inculcate not what -PRON- learn there but the folly of -PRON- -PRON- title
schoolmaster would very naturally seem derived from the name bestow
upon the harem -PRON- but some have surmise that the man who first
thus entitle this sort of ottoman whale must have read the memoir of
vidocq and inform -PRON- what sort of a country schoolmaster that
famous frenchman be in -PRON- young day and what be the nature of
those occult lesson -PRON- inculcate into some of -PRON- pupil

the same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmaster whale
betak -PRON- in -PRON- advance year be true of all age sperm
whale almost universally a lone whale as a solitary leviathan be
call prove an ancient one like venerable moss bearded daniel boone
-PRON- will have no one near -PRON- but nature -PRON- and -PRON- -PRON- take to
wife in the wilderness of water and the good of wife -PRON- be though
-PRON- keep so many moody secret

the school compose none but young and vigorous male previously
mention offer a strong contrast to the harem school for while
those female whale be characteristically timid the young male or
forty barrel bull as -PRON- call -PRON- be by far the most pugnacious
of all leviathans and proverbially the most dangerous to encounter
except those wondrous grey head grizzle whale sometimes meet
and these will fight -PRON- like grim fiend exasperate by a penal gout

the forty barrel bull school be large than the harem school like
a mob of young collegian -PRON- be full of fight fun and wickedness
tumble round the world at such a reckless rollicking rate that no
prudent underwriter would insure -PRON- any more than -PRON- would a riotous
lad at yale or harvard -PRON- soon relinquish this turbulence though
and when about three fourth grow break up and separately go about in
quest of settlement that is harem

another point of difference between the male and female school be
still more characteristic of the sex say -PRON- strike a
forty barrel bull poor devil all -PRON- comrade quit -PRON- but strike
a member of the harem school and -PRON- companion swim around -PRON- with
every token of concern sometimes linger so near -PRON- and so long as
-PRON- to fall a prey



chapter 89 fast fish and loose fish


the allusion to the waif and waif pole in the last chapter but one
necessitate some account of the law and regulation of the whale
fishery of which the waif may be deem the grand symbol and badge

-PRON- frequently happen that when several ship be cruise in company
a whale may be strike by one vessel then escape and be finally kill
and capture by another vessel and herein be indirectly comprised
many minor contingency all partaking of this one grand feature for
example after a weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale
the body may get loose from the ship by reason of a violent storm and
drift far away to leeward be retake by a second whaler who in a
calm snugly tow -PRON- alongside without risk of life or line thus
the most vexatious and violent dispute would often arise between
the fisherman be there not some write or unwritten universal
undisputed law applicable to all case

perhaps the only formal whaling code authorize by legislative
enactment be that of holland -PRON- be decree by the states general in
a.d. 1695 but though no other nation have ever have any write whaling
law yet the american fisherman have be -PRON- own legislator and
lawyer in this matter -PRON- have provide a system which for terse
comprehensiveness surpass justinian 's pandects and the by law of
the chinese society for the suppression of meddling with other people 's
business yes these law may be engraven on a queen anne 's farthing
or the barb of a harpoon and wear round the neck so small be -PRON-

i. a fast fish belong to the party fast to -PRON-

ii a loose fish be fair game for anybody who can soonest catch -PRON-

but what play the mischief with this masterly code be the admirable
brevity of -PRON- which necessitate a vast volume of commentary to
expound -PRON-

first what be a fast fish alive or dead a fish be technically fast
when -PRON- be connect with an occupy ship or boat by any medium at all
controllable by the occupant or occupant a mast an oar a nine inch
cable a telegraph wire or a strand of cobweb -PRON- be all the same
likewise a fish be technically fast when -PRON- bear a waif or any other
recognised symbol of possession so long as the party waif -PRON- plainly
evince -PRON- ability at any time to take -PRON- alongside as well as -PRON-
intention so to do

these be scientific commentary but the commentary of the whaleman
-PRON- sometimes consist in hard word and hard knock the
coke upon littleton of the fist true among the more upright and
honourable whaleman allowance be always make for peculiar case
where -PRON- would be an outrageous moral injustice for one party to claim
possession of a whale previously chase or kill by another party but
other be by no mean so scrupulous

some fifty year ago there be a curious case of whale trover litigate
in england wherein the plaintiff set forth that after a hard chase of
a whale in the northern seas and when indeed -PRON- the plaintiff have
succeed in harpoon the fish -PRON- be at last through peril of
-PRON- life oblige to forsake not only -PRON- line but -PRON- boat
-PRON- ultimately the defendant the crew of another ship come up
with the whale strike kill seize and finally appropriate -PRON-
before the very eye of the plaintiff and when those defendant be
remonstrate with -PRON- captain snap -PRON- finger in the plaintiff
tooth and assure -PRON- that by way of doxology to the deed -PRON- have do
-PRON- would now retain -PRON- line harpoon and boat which have remain
attach to the whale at the time of the seizure wherefore the
plaintiff now sue for the recovery of the value of -PRON- whale line
harpoon and boat

mr. erskine be counsel for the defendant lord ellenborough be
the judge in the course of the defence the witty erskine go on
to illustrate -PRON- position by allude to a recent crim con
case wherein a gentleman after in vain try to bridle -PRON- wife 's
viciousness have at last abandon -PRON- upon the sea of life but in
the course of year repenting of that step -PRON- institute an action to
recover possession of -PRON- erskine be on the other side and -PRON-
then support -PRON- by say that though the gentleman have originally
harpooned the lady and have once have -PRON- fast and only by reason of the
great stress of -PRON- plunge viciousness have at last abandon -PRON- yet
abandon -PRON- -PRON- do so that -PRON- become a loose fish and therefore
when a subsequent gentleman re harpoon -PRON- the lady then become that
subsequent gentleman 's property along with whatev harpoon may have
be find stick in -PRON-

now in the present case erskine contend that the example of the whale
and the lady be reciprocally illustrative of each other

these pleading and the counter pleading be duly hear the very
learn judge in set term decide to wit that as for the boat -PRON-
award -PRON- to the plaintiff because -PRON- have merely abandon -PRON-
to save -PRON- life but that with regard to the controverted whale
harpoon and line -PRON- belong to the defendant the whale because
-PRON- be a loose fish at the time of the final capture and the harpoon
and line because when the fish make off with -PRON- -PRON- the fish
acquire a property in those article and hence anybody who afterwards
take the fish have a right to -PRON- now the defendant afterwards take
the fish ergo the aforesaid article be -PRON-

a common man look at this decision of the very learn judge may
possibly object to -PRON- but plough up to the primary rock of the
matter the two great principle lay down in the twin whaling law
previously quote and apply and elucidate by lord ellenborough in
the above cite case these two law touch fast fish and loose fish
-PRON- say will on reflection be find the fundamental of all human
jurisprudence for notwithstand -PRON- complicated tracery of sculpture
the temple of the law like the temple of the philistines have but two
prop to stand on

be -PRON- not a saying in every one 's mouth possession be half of the law
that be regardless of how the thing come into possession but often
possession be the whole of the law what be the sinew and soul of
russian serf and republican slave but fast fish whereof possession be
the whole of the law what to the rapacious landlord be the widow 's last
mite but a fast fish what be yonder undetected villain 's marble mansion
with a door plate for a waif what be that but a fast fish what be the
ruinous discount which mordecai the broker get from poor woebegone
the bankrupt on a loan to keep woebegone 's family from starvation
what be that ruinous discount but a fast fish what be the archbishop of
savesoul 's income of l100,000 seize from the scant bread and cheese
of hundred of thousand of break back laborer all sure of heaven
without any of savesoul 's help what be that globular l100,000 but a
fast fish what be the duke of dunder 's hereditary town and hamlet
but fast fish what to that redoubt harpooneer john bull be poor
ireland but a fast fish what to that apostolic lancer brother
jonathan be texas but a fast fish and concern all these be not
possession the whole of the law

but if the doctrine of fast fish be pretty generally applicable
the kindred doctrine of loose fish be still more widely so that be
internationally and universally applicable

what be america in 1492 but a loose fish in which columbus strike the
spanish standard by way of waif -PRON- for -PRON- royal master and mistress
what be poland to the czar what greece to the turk what india
to england what at last will mexico be to the united states all
loose fish

what be the rights of man and the liberties of the world but
loose fish what all man 's mind and opinion but loose fish what be
the principle of religious belief in -PRON- but a loose fish what to
the ostentatious smuggling verbalist be the thought of thinker but
loose fish what be the great globe -PRON- but a loose fish and what
be -PRON- reader but a loose fish and a fast fish too



chapter 90 head or tail


de balena vero sufficit si rex habeat caput et regina caudam
bracton l. 3 c. 3


latin from the book of the laws of england which take along with the
context mean that of all whale capture by anybody on the coast of
that land the king as honourary grand harpooneer must have the head
and the queen be respectfully present with the tail a division which
in the whale be much like halve an apple there be no intermediate
remainder now as this law under a modify form be to this day in
force in england and as -PRON- offer in various respect a strange anomaly
touch the general law of fast and loose fish -PRON- be here treat of
in a separate chapter on the same courteous principle that prompt
the english railway to be at the expense of a separate car specially
reserve for the accommodation of royalty in the first place in
curious proof of the fact that the above mention law be still in
force -PRON- proce to lay before -PRON- a circumstance that happen within
the last two year

-PRON- seem that some honest mariner of dover or sandwich or some one
of the cinque ports have after a hard chase succeed in killing and
beach a fine whale which -PRON- have originally descry afar off from
the shore now the cinque ports be partially or somehow under the
jurisdiction of a sort of policeman or beadle call a lord warden
hold the office directly from the crown -PRON- believe all the royal
emolument incident to the cinque port territory become by assignment
-PRON- by some writer this office be call a sinecure but not so
because the lord warden be busily employ at time in fob -PRON-
perquisite which be -PRON- chiefly by virtue of that same fobbing of
-PRON-

now when these poor sun burn mariner bare foot and with -PRON-
trowser roll high up on -PRON- eely leg have wearily haul -PRON- fat
fish high and dry promise -PRON- a good l150 from the precious
oil and bone and in fantasy sip rare tea with -PRON- wife and good
ale with -PRON- crony upon the strength of -PRON- respective share up
step a very learn and most christian and charitable gentleman with
a copy of blackstone under -PRON- arm and lay -PRON- upon the whale 's head
-PRON- says--"hand off this fish -PRON- master be a fast fish -PRON- seize -PRON-
as the lord warden 's upon this the poor mariner in -PRON- respectful
consternation so truly english know not what to say fall to
vigorously scratch -PRON- head all round meanwhile ruefully glance
from the whale to the stranger but that do in nowise mend the matter
or at all soften the hard heart of the learn gentleman with the copy
of blackstone at length one of -PRON- after long scratch about for
-PRON- idea make bold to speak

please sir who be the lord warden

the duke

but the duke have nothing to do with take this fish

-PRON- be -PRON-

-PRON- have be at great trouble and peril and some expense and be
all that to go to the duke 's benefit -PRON- get nothing at all for -PRON-
pain but -PRON- blister

-PRON- be -PRON-

be the duke so very poor as to be force to this desperate mode of
get a livelihood

-PRON- be -PRON-

-PRON- think to relieve -PRON- old bed ride mother by part of -PRON- share of
this whale

-PRON- be -PRON-

wo n't the duke be content with a quarter or a half

-PRON- be -PRON-

in a word the whale be seize and sell and -PRON- grace the duke of
wellington receive the money think that view in some particular
light the case may by a bare possibility in some small degree be
deem under the circumstance a rather hard one an honest clergyman
of the town respectfully address a note to -PRON- grace beg -PRON- to
take the case of those unfortunate mariner into full consideration to
which -PRON- lord duke in substance reply both letter be publish
that -PRON- have already do so and receive the money and would be
oblige to the reverend gentleman if for the future -PRON- the reverend
gentleman would decline meddling with other people 's business be
this the still militant old man stand at the corner of the three
kingdom on all hand coerce alm of beggar

-PRON- will readily be see that in this case the alleged right of the
duke to the whale be a delegate one from the sovereign -PRON- must need
inquire then on what principle the sovereign be originally invest with
that right the law -PRON- have already be set forth but plowdon give
-PRON- the reason for -PRON- say plowdon the whale so catch belong to
the king and queen because of -PRON- superior excellence and by the
sound commentator this have ever be hold a cogent argument in such
matter

but why should the king have the head and the queen the tail a reason
for that ye lawyer

in -PRON- treatise on queen gold or queen pinmoney an old king 's bench
author one william prynne thus discourseth ye tail be ye queen 's
that ye queen 's wardrobe may be supply with ye whalebone now this
be write at a time when the black limber bone of the greenland or
right whale be largely use in lady bodice but this same bone
be not in the tail -PRON- be in the head which be a sad mistake for
a sagacious lawyer like prynne but be the queen a mermaid to be
present with a tail an allegorical meaning may lurk here

there be two royal fish so style by the english law writer the whale
and the sturgeon both royal property under certain limitation and
nominally supply the tenth branch of the crown 's ordinary revenue
-PRON- know not that any other author have hint of the matter but by
inference -PRON- seem to -PRON- that the sturgeon must be divide in the same
way as the whale the king receive the highly dense and elastic head
peculiar to that fish which symbolically regard may possibly be
humorously ground upon some presume congeniality and thus there
seem a reason in all thing even in law



chapter 91 the pequod meets the rose bud


in vain -PRON- be to rake for ambergriese in the paunch of this leviathan
insufferable fetor deny not inquiry sir t. browne v.e.


-PRON- be a week or two after the last whaling scene recount and when -PRON-
be slowly sail over a sleepy vapoury mid day sea that the many
nose on the pequod 's deck prove more vigilant discoverer than the
three pair of eye aloft a peculiar and not very pleasant smell be
smelt in the sea

-PRON- will bet something now say stubb that somewhere hereabout be
some of those drug whale -PRON- tickle the other day -PRON- think -PRON-
would keel up before long

presently the vapour in advance slide aside and there in the distance
lie a ship whose furled sail betoken that some sort of whale must be
alongside as -PRON- glide nearer the stranger show french colour from
-PRON- peak and by the eddy cloud of vulture sea fowl that circle and
hover and swoop around -PRON- -PRON- be plain that the whale alongside
must be what the fisherman call a blast whale that is a whale that
have die unmolested on the sea and so float an unappropriated corpse
-PRON- may well be conceive what an unsavory odor such a mass must
exhale bad than an assyrian city in the plague when the living be
incompetent to bury the depart so intolerable indeed be -PRON- regard
by some that no cupidity could persuade -PRON- to moor alongside of -PRON-
yet be there those who will still do -PRON- notwithstand the fact that
the oil obtain from such subject be of a very inferior quality and
by no mean of the nature of attar of rose

come still nearer with the expire breeze -PRON- see that the frenchman
have a second whale alongside and this second whale seem even more
of a nosegay than the first in truth -PRON- turn out to be one of
those problematical whale that seem to dry up and die with a sort
of prodigious dyspepsia or indigestion leave -PRON- defunct body
almost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil nevertheless in the
proper place -PRON- shall see that no know fisherman will ever turn
up -PRON- nose at such a whale as this however much -PRON- may shun blast
whale in general

the pequod have now sweep so nigh to the stranger that stubb vow
-PRON- recognise -PRON- cutting spade pole entangle in the line that be
knot round the tail of one of these whale

there be a pretty fellow now -PRON- banteringly laugh stand in the
ship 's bow there be a jackal for ye -PRON- well know that these crappoe
of frenchman be but poor devil in the fishery sometimes lower
-PRON- boat for breaker mistake -PRON- for sperm whale spout yes
and sometimes sail from -PRON- port with -PRON- hold full of box of
tallow candle and case of snuffer foresee that all the oil -PRON-
will get will not be enough to dip the captain 's wick into aye -PRON- all
know these thing but look ye here be a crappo that be content with -PRON-
leaving the drugged whale there -PRON- mean aye and be content too with
scrap the dry bone of that other precious fish -PRON- have there poor
devil -PRON- say pas round a hat some one and let 's make -PRON- a present
of a little oil for dear charity 's sake for what oil -PRON- will get from
that drugged whale there would not be fit to burn in a jail no not
in a condemn cell and as for the other whale why -PRON- will agree to get
more oil by chop up and try out these three mast of our than
-PRON- will get from that bundle of bone though now that -PRON- think of -PRON- -PRON-
may contain something worth a good deal more than oil yes ambergris
-PRON- wonder now if -PRON- old man have think of that -PRON- be worth try yes
-PRON- be for -PRON- and so say -PRON- start for the quarter deck

by this time the faint air have become a complete calm so that whether
or no the pequod be now fairly entrap in the smell with no hope of
escape except by -PRON- breeze up again issue from the cabin stubb
now call -PRON- boat 's crew and pull off for the stranger draw
across -PRON- bow -PRON- perceive that in accordance with the fanciful french
taste the upper part of -PRON- stem piece be carve in the likeness of a
huge drooping stalk be paint green and for thorn have copper
spike project from -PRON- here and there the whole terminating in a
symmetrical fold bulb of a bright red colour upon -PRON- head board in
large gilt letter -PRON- read bouton de rose rose button or rose bud
and this be the romantic name of this aromatic ship

though stubb do not understand the bouton part of the inscription yet
the word rose and the bulbous figure head put together sufficiently
explain the whole to -PRON-

a wooden rose bud eh -PRON- cry with -PRON- hand to -PRON- nose that will
do very well but how like all creation -PRON- smell

now in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck -PRON-
have to pull round the bow to the starboard side and thus come close to
the blasted whale and so talk over -PRON-

arrived then at this spot with one hand still to -PRON- nose -PRON-
bawled--"bouton de rose ahoy be there any of -PRON- bouton de rose that
speak english

yes rejoin a guernsey man from the bulwark who turn out to be
the chief mate

well then -PRON- bouton de rose bud have -PRON- see the white whale

what whale

the white whale a sperm whale moby dick have ye see -PRON-

never hear of such a whale cachalot blanche white whale no

very good then good bye now and -PRON- will call again in a minute

then rapidly pull back towards the pequod and see ahab lean
over the quarter deck rail await -PRON- report -PRON- mould -PRON- two hand
into a trumpet and shouted--"no sir no upon which ahab retire and
stubb return to the frenchman

-PRON- now perceive that the guernsey man who have just get into the
chain and be use a cutting spade have sling -PRON- nose in a sort of
bag

what be the matter with -PRON- nose there say stubb broke -PRON-

-PRON- wish -PRON- be break or that -PRON- do not have any nose at all answer
the guernsey man who do not seem to relish the job -PRON- be at very
much but what be -PRON- hold yours for

oh nothing -PRON- be a wax nose -PRON- have to hold -PRON- on fine day be not -PRON-
air rather gardenny -PRON- should say throw -PRON- a bunch of posy will ye
bouton de rose

what in the devil 's name do -PRON- want here roar the guernseyman
fly into a sudden passion

oh keep cool cool yes that be the word why do not -PRON- pack those
whale in ice while -PRON- be work at 'em but joke aside though do
-PRON- know rose bud that -PRON- be all nonsense try to get any oil out of
such whale as for that dry up one there -PRON- hasn't a gill in -PRON-
whole carcase

-PRON- know that well enough but d'ye see the captain here will not believe
-PRON- this be -PRON- first voyage -PRON- be a cologne manufacturer before but
come aboard and mayhap -PRON- will believe -PRON- if -PRON- will not -PRON- and so -PRON- will
get out of this dirty scrape

anything to oblige ye -PRON- sweet and pleasant fellow rejoin stubb
and with that -PRON- soon mount to the deck there a queer scene present
-PRON- the sailor in tasselled cap of red worst be get the
heavy tackle in readiness for the whale but -PRON- work rather slow
and talk very fast and seem in anything but a good humor all -PRON-
nose upwardly project from -PRON- face like so many jib boom
now and then pair of -PRON- would drop -PRON- work and run up to the
mast head to get some fresh air some thinking -PRON- would catch the
plague dip oakum in coal tar and at interval hold -PRON- to -PRON-
nostril other have break the stem of -PRON- pipe almost short
off at the bowl be vigorously puff tobacco smoke so that -PRON-
constantly fill -PRON- olfactorie

stubb be strike by a shower of outcry and anathema proceed from
the captain 's round house abaft and look in that direction see a
fiery face thrust from behind the door which be hold ajar from within
this be the tormented surgeon who after in vain remonstrate
against the proceeding of the day have betake -PRON- to the captain 's
round house cabinet -PRON- call -PRON- to avoid the pest but still could
not help yell out -PRON- entreaty and indignation at time

mark all this stubb argue well for -PRON- scheme and turn to the
guernsey man have a little chat with -PRON- during which the stranger mate
express -PRON- detestation of -PRON- captain as a conceited ignoramus
who have bring -PRON- all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle
sound -PRON- carefully stubb further perceive that the guernsey man
have not the slight suspicion concern the ambergris -PRON- therefore
hold -PRON- peace on that head but otherwise be quite frank and
confidential with -PRON- so that the two quickly concoct a little plan
for both circumventing and satirize the captain without -PRON- at all
dreaming of distrust -PRON- sincerity accord to this little plan
of -PRON- the guernsey man under cover of an interpreter 's office be
to tell the captain what -PRON- please but as come from stubb and as
for stubb -PRON- be to utter any nonsense that should come uppermost in
-PRON- during the interview

by this time -PRON- destine victim appear from -PRON- cabin -PRON- be a
small and dark but rather delicate look man for a sea captain with
large whisker and moustache however and wear a red cotton velvet vest
with watch seal at -PRON- side to this gentleman stubb be now politely
introduce by the guernsey man who at once ostentatiously put on the
aspect of interpret between -PRON-

what shall -PRON- say to -PRON- first say -PRON-

why say stubb eye the velvet vest and the watch and seal -PRON-
may as well begin by tell -PRON- that -PRON- look a sort of babyish to -PRON-
though -PRON- do not pretend to be a judge

-PRON- say monsieur say the guernsey man in french turn to -PRON-
captain that only yesterday -PRON- ship speak a vessel whose captain
and chief mate with six sailor have all die of a fever catch from a
blast whale -PRON- have bring alongside

upon this the captain start and eagerly desire to know more

what now say the guernsey man to stubb

why since -PRON- take -PRON- so easy tell -PRON- that now -PRON- have eye -PRON-
carefully -PRON- be quite certain that -PRON- be no more fit to command a
whale ship than a st. jago monkey in fact tell -PRON- from -PRON- -PRON- be a
baboon

-PRON- vow and declare monsieur that the other whale the dry one be
far more deadly than the blast one in fine monsieur -PRON- conjure -PRON-
as -PRON- value -PRON- life to cut loose from these fish

instantly the captain run forward and in a loud voice command -PRON-
crew to desist from hoist the cutting tackle and at once cast loose
the cable and chain confine the whale to the ship

what now say the guernsey man when the captain have return to
-PRON-

why let -PRON- see yes -PRON- may as well tell -PRON- now that that in
fact tell -PRON- -PRON- have diddle -PRON- and aside to -PRON- perhaps somebody
else

-PRON- say monsieur that -PRON- be very happy to have be of any service to
-PRON-

hear this the captain vow that -PRON- be the grateful party
mean -PRON- and mate and conclude by invite stubb down into -PRON-
cabin to drink a bottle of bordeaux

-PRON- want -PRON- to take a glass of wine with -PRON- say the interpreter

thank -PRON- heartily but tell -PRON- -PRON- be against -PRON- principle to drink
with the man -PRON- have diddle in fact tell -PRON- -PRON- must go

-PRON- say monsieur that -PRON- principle will not admit of -PRON- drinking but
that if monsieur want to live another day to drink then monsieur have
best drop all four boat and pull the ship away from these whale for
-PRON- be so calm -PRON- will not drift

by this time stubb be over the side and get into -PRON- boat hail
the guernsey man to this effect that have a long tow line in -PRON-
boat -PRON- would do what -PRON- could to help -PRON- by pull out the light
whale of the two from the ship 's side while the frenchman 's boat
then be engage in tow the ship one way stubb benevolently tow
away at -PRON- whale the other way ostentatiously slack out a most
unusually long tow line

presently a breeze spring up stubb feign to cast off from the whale
hoist -PRON- boat the frenchman soon increase -PRON- distance while the
pequod slide in between -PRON- and stubb 's whale whereupon stubb quickly
pull to the float body and hail the pequod to give notice of
-PRON- intention at once proceed to reap the fruit of -PRON- unrighteous
cunning seize -PRON- sharp boat spade -PRON- commence an excavation in the
body a little behind the side fin -PRON- would almost have think -PRON- be
dig a cellar there in the sea and when at length -PRON- spade strike
against the gaunt rib -PRON- be like turn up old roman tile and
pottery bury in fat english loam -PRON- boat 's crew be all in high
excitement eagerly help -PRON- chief and look as anxious as
gold hunter

and all the time numberless fowl be dive and duck and
scream and yelling and fight around -PRON- stubb be begin
to look disappointed especially as the horrible nosegay increase when
suddenly from out the very heart of this plague there steal a faint
stream of perfume which flow through the tide of bad smell without
be absorb by -PRON- as one river will flow into and then along with
another without at all blend with -PRON- for a time

-PRON- have -PRON- -PRON- have -PRON- cry stubb with delight strike something in
the subterranean region a purse a purse

drop -PRON- spade -PRON- thrust both hand in and draw out handful
of something that look like ripe windsor soap or rich mottle old
cheese very unctuous and savory withal -PRON- may easily dent -PRON- with
-PRON- thumb -PRON- be of a hue between yellow and ash colour and this good
friend be ambergris worth a gold guinea an ounce to any druggist
some six handful be obtain but more be unavoidably lose in the
sea and still more perhaps may have be secure be -PRON- not for
impatient ahab 's loud command to stubb to desist and come on board
else the ship would bid -PRON- good bye



chapter 92 ambergris


now this ambergris be a very curious substance and so important as
an article of commerce that in 1791 a certain nantucket bear captain
coffin be examine at the bar of the english house of commons on that
subject for at that time and indeed until a comparatively late day
the precise origin of ambergris remain like amber -PRON- a problem
to the learn though the word ambergris be but the french compound for
grey amber yet the two substance be quite distinct for amber though
at time find on the sea coast be also dig up in some far inland
soil whereas ambergris be never find except upon the sea besides
amber be a hard transparent brittle odorless substance use for
mouth piece to pipe for bead and ornament but ambergris be soft
waxy and so highly fragrant and spicy that -PRON- be largely use in
perfumery in pastile precious candle hair powder and pomatum
the turks use -PRON- in cooking and also carry -PRON- to mecca for the same
purpose that frankincense be carry to st. peter 's in rome some wine
merchant drop a few grain into claret to flavor -PRON-

who would think then that such fine lady and gentleman should regale
-PRON- with an essence find in the inglorious bowel of a sick
whale yet so -PRON- be by some ambergris be suppose to be the cause and
by other the effect of the dyspepsia in the whale how to cure such
a dyspepsia -PRON- be hard to say unless by administer three or four
boat load of brandreth 's pill and then run out of harm 's way as
laborer do in blast rock

-PRON- have forget to say that there be find in this ambergris certain
hard round bony plate which at first stubb think may be sailor
trowser button but -PRON- afterwards turn out that -PRON- be nothing
more than piece of small squid bone embalm in that manner

now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be
find in the heart of such decay be this nothing bethink thee of that
say of st. paul in corinthians about corruption and incorruption
how that -PRON- be sow in dishonour but raise in glory and likewise
call to mind that say of paracelsus about what -PRON- be that maketh
the good musk also forget not the strange fact that of all thing of
ill savor cologne water in -PRON- rudimental manufacturing stage be the
bad

-PRON- should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal but can not
owe to -PRON- anxiety to repel a charge often make against whaleman
and which in the estimation of some already biased mind may be
consider as indirectly substantiate by what have be say of
the frenchman 's two whale elsewhere in this volume the slanderous
aspersion have be disprove that the vocation of whaling be throughout
a slatternly untidy business but there be another thing to rebut -PRON-
hint that all whale always smell bad now how do this odious stigma
originate

-PRON- opine that -PRON- be plainly traceable to the first arrival of the
greenland whaling ship in london more than two century ago because
those whaleman do not then and do not now try out -PRON- oil at sea as
the southern ship have always do but cut up the fresh blubber in
small bit thrust -PRON- through the bung hole of large cask and carry
-PRON- home in that manner the shortness of the season in those icy seas
and the sudden and violent storm to which -PRON- be expose forbid
any other course the consequence be that upon break into the hold
and unload one of these whale cemetery in the greenland dock a
savor be give forth somewhat similar to that arise from excavate an
old city grave yard for the foundation of a lie in hospital

-PRON- partly surmise also that this wicked charge against whaler may be
likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of greenland in former
time of a dutch village call schmerenburgh or smeerenberg which
latter name be the one use by the learn fogo von slack in -PRON- great
work on smells a text book on that subject as -PRON- name import smeer
fat berg to put up this village be found in order to afford a
place for the blubber of the dutch whale fleet to be try out without
be take home to holland for that purpose -PRON- be a collection of
furnace fat kettle and oil shed and when the work be in full
operation certainly give forth no very pleasant savor but all this be
quite different with a south sea sperm whaler which in a voyage of four
year perhaps after completely fill -PRON- hold with oil do not
perhaps consume fifty day in the business of boil out and in the
state that -PRON- be cask the oil be nearly scentless the truth be that
living or dead if but decently treat whale as a specie be by
no means creature of ill odor nor can whaleman be recognise as the
people of the middle age affect to detect a jew in the company by
the nose nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant
when as a general thing -PRON- enjoy such high health take abundance
of exercise always out of door though -PRON- be true seldom in the
open air -PRON- say that the motion of a sperm whale 's fluke above water
dispense a perfume as when a musk scent lady rustle -PRON- dress in a
warm parlor what then shall -PRON- liken the sperm whale to for fragrance
consider -PRON- magnitude must -PRON- not be to that famous elephant with
jewelled tusk and redolent with myrrh which be lead out of an indian
town to do honour to alexander the great



chapter 93 the castaway


-PRON- be but some few day after encounter the frenchman that a most
significant event befall the most insignificant of the pequod 's crew an
event most lamentable and which end in provide the sometimes
madly merry and predestinated craft with a living and ever accompany
prophecy of whatev shatter sequel may prove -PRON- own

now in the whale ship -PRON- be not every one that go in the boat some
few hand be reserve call ship keeper whose province -PRON- be to work
the vessel while the boat be pursue the whale as a general thing
these ship keeper be as hardy fellow as the man comprise the boat
crew but if there happen to be an unduly slender clumsy or timorous
wight in the ship that wight be certain to be make a ship keeper -PRON-
be so in the pequod with the little negro pippin by nick name pip by
abbreviation poor pip ye have hear of -PRON- before ye must remember
-PRON- tambourine on that dramatic midnight so gloomy jolly

in outer aspect pip and dough boy make a match like a black pony and a
white one of equal development though of dissimilar colour drive in
one eccentric span but while hapless dough boy be by nature dull and
torpid in -PRON- intellect pip though over tender heart be at bottom
very bright with that pleasant genial jolly brightness peculiar to
-PRON- tribe a tribe which ever enjoy all holiday and festivity with
finer free relish than any other race for black the year 's calendar
should show naught but three hundred and sixty five fourth of julys and
new year 's day nor smile so while -PRON- write that this little black be
brilliant for even blackness have -PRON- brilliancy behold yon lustrous
ebony panel in king 's cabinet but pip love life and all life 's
peaceable security so that the panic striking business in which -PRON-
have somehow unaccountably become entrap have most sadly blur -PRON-
brightness though as ere long will be see what be thus temporarily
subdue in -PRON- in the end be destine to be luridly illumine by
strange wild fire that fictitiously show -PRON- off to ten time the
natural lustre with which in -PRON- native tolland county in connecticut
-PRON- have once enliven many a fiddler 's frolic on the green and at
melodious even tide with -PRON- gay ha ha have turn the round horizon
into one star bell tambourine so though in the clear air of day
suspend against a blue veined neck the pure watered diamond drop
will healthful glow yet when the cunning jeweller would show -PRON-
the diamond in -PRON- most impressive lustre -PRON- lay -PRON- against a gloomy
ground and then light -PRON- up not by the sun but by some unnatural
gas then come out those fiery effulgence infernally superb then
the evil blaze diamond once the divine symbol of the crystal sky
look like some crown jewel steal from the king of hell but let -PRON- to
the story

-PRON- come to pass that in the ambergris affair stubb 's after oarsman
chance so to sprain -PRON- hand as for a time to become quite maimed
and temporarily pip be put into -PRON- place

the first time stubb lower with -PRON- pip evince much nervousness
but happily for that time escape close contact with the whale and
therefore come off not altogether discreditably though stubb observe
-PRON- take care afterwards to exhort -PRON- to cherish -PRON- courageousness
to the utmost for -PRON- may often find -PRON- needful

now upon the second lowering the boat paddle upon the whale and as
the fish receive the darted iron -PRON- give -PRON- customary rap which
happen in this instance to be right under poor pip 's seat the
involuntary consternation of the moment cause -PRON- to leap paddle in
hand out of the boat and in such a way that part of the slack whale
line come against -PRON- chest -PRON- breast -PRON- overboard with -PRON- so as
to become entangled in -PRON- when at last plumping into the water that
instant the stricken whale start on a fierce run the line swiftly
straighten and presto poor pip come all foam up to the chock
of the boat remorselessly drag there by the line which have take
several turn around -PRON- chest and neck

tashtego stand in the bow -PRON- be full of the fire of the hunt -PRON-
hat pip for a poltroon snatch the boat knife from -PRON- sheath
-PRON- suspend -PRON- sharp edge over the line and turn towards stubb
exclaim interrogatively cut meantime pip 's blue choke face
plainly look do for god 's sake all pass in a flash in less than
half a minute this entire thing happen

damn -PRON- cut roar stubb and so the whale be lose and pip be
save

so soon as -PRON- recover -PRON- the poor little negro be assail
by yell and execration from the crew tranquilly permit these
irregular cursing to evaporate stubb then in a plain business like
but still half humorous manner curse pip officially and that do
unofficially give -PRON- much wholesome advice the substance be never
jump from a boat pip except but all the rest be indefinite as the
sound advice ever be now in general stick to the boat be -PRON-
true motto in whaling but case will sometimes happen when leap from
the boat be still good moreover as if perceive at last that if -PRON-
should give undiluted conscientious advice to pip -PRON- would be leave
-PRON- too wide a margin to jump in for the future stubb suddenly drop
all advice and conclude with a peremptory command stick to the boat
pip or by the lord -PRON- will not pick -PRON- up if -PRON- jump mind that -PRON-
can not afford to lose whale by the like of -PRON- a whale would sell for
thirty time what -PRON- would pip in alabama bear that in mind and
do not jump any more hereby perhaps stubb indirectly hint that
though man love -PRON- fellow yet man be a money make animal which
propensity too often interfere with -PRON- benevolence

but -PRON- be all in the hand of the gods and pip jump again -PRON- be
under very similar circumstance to the first performance but this time
-PRON- do not breast out the line and hence when the whale start to
run pip be leave behind on the sea like a hurried traveller 's trunk
alas stubb be but too true to -PRON- word -PRON- be a beautiful bounteous
blue day the spangle sea calm and cool and flatly stretch away
all round to the horizon like gold beater 's skin hammer out to the
extremest bob up and down in that sea pip 's ebon head show
like a head of clove no boat knife be lift when -PRON- fall so rapidly
astern stubb 's inexorable back be turn upon -PRON- and the whale be
winged in three minute a whole mile of shoreless ocean be between
pip and stubb out from the centre of the sea poor pip turn -PRON-
crisp curl black head to the sun another lonely castaway though
the lofty and the bright

now in calm weather to swim in the open ocean be as easy to the
practised swimmer as to ride in a spring carriage ashore but the awful
lonesomeness be intolerable the intense concentration of self in the
middle of such a heartless immensity -PRON- god who can tell -PRON- mark how
when sailor in a dead calm bathe in the open sea mark how closely -PRON-
hug -PRON- ship and only coast along -PRON- side

but have stubb really abandon the poor little negro to -PRON- fate no -PRON-
do not mean to at least because there be two boat in -PRON- wake
and -PRON- suppose no doubt that -PRON- would of course come up to pip very
quickly and pick -PRON- up though indeed such consideration towards
oarsman jeopardize through -PRON- own timidity be not always manifest
by the hunter in all similar instance and such instance not
unfrequently occur almost invariably in the fishery a coward so
call be mark with the same ruthless detestation peculiar to
military navy and army

but -PRON- so happen that those boat without see pip suddenly
spy whale close to -PRON- on one side turn and give chase and
stubb 's boat be now so far away and -PRON- and all -PRON- crew so intent
upon -PRON- fish that pip 's ring horizon begin to expand around -PRON-
miserably by the mere chance the ship -PRON- at last rescue -PRON- but
from that hour the little negro go about the deck an idiot such at
least -PRON- say -PRON- be the sea have jeeringly keep -PRON- finite body
up but drown the infinite of -PRON- soul not drown entirely though
rather carry down alive to wondrous depth where strange shape of
the unwarped primal world glide to and fro before -PRON- passive eye
and the miser merman wisdom reveal -PRON- hoard heap and among the
joyous heartless ever juvenile eternity pip see the multitudinous
god omnipresent coral insect that out of the firmament of water
heave the colossal orb -PRON- see god 's foot upon the treadle of the
loom and speak -PRON- and therefore -PRON- shipmates call -PRON- mad so man 's
insanity be heaven 's sense and wander from all mortal reason man
come at last to that celestial thought which to reason be absurd and
frantic and weal or woe feel then uncompromised indifferent as -PRON-
god

for the rest blame not stubb too hardly the thing be common in that
fishery and in the sequel of the narrative -PRON- will then be see what
like abandonment befall -PRON-



chapter 94 a squeeze of the hand


that whale of stubb 's so dearly purchase be duly bring to
the pequod 's side where all those cut and hoist operation
previously detail be regularly go through even to the baling of
the heidelburgh tun or case

while some be occupy with this latter duty other be employ
in drag away the large tub so soon as fill with the sperm and
when the proper time arrive this same sperm be carefully manipulate
ere go to the try work of which anon

-PRON- have cool and crystallize to such a degree that when with several
other -PRON- sit down before a large constantine 's bath of -PRON- -PRON- find
-PRON- strangely concrete into lump here and there roll about in the
liquid part -PRON- be -PRON- business to squeeze these lump back into fluid
a sweet and unctuous duty no wonder that in old time this sperm be
such a favourite cosmetic such a clear such a sweetener such a
softener such a delicious molifier after have -PRON- hand in -PRON- for
only a few minute -PRON- finger feel like eel and begin as -PRON- be to
serpentine and spiralise

as -PRON- sit there at -PRON- ease cross legg on the deck after the bitter
exertion at the windlass under a blue tranquil sky the ship under
indolent sail and glide so serenely along as -PRON- bath -PRON- hand among
those soft gentle globule of infiltrate tissue weave almost within
the hour as -PRON- richly break to -PRON- finger and discharge all -PRON-
opulence like fully ripe grape -PRON- wine as -PRON- snuff up that
uncontaminated aroma literally and truly like the smell of spring
violet -PRON- declare to -PRON- that for the time -PRON- live as in a musky
meadow -PRON- forget all about -PRON- horrible oath in that inexpressible
sperm -PRON- wash -PRON- hand and -PRON- heart of -PRON- -PRON- almost begin to credit
the old paracelsan superstition that sperm be of rare virtue in allay
the heat of anger while bath in that bath -PRON- feel divinely free from
all ill will or petulance or malice of any sort whatsoever

squeeze squeeze squeeze all the morning long -PRON- squeeze that sperm
till -PRON- -PRON- almost melt into -PRON- -PRON- squeeze that sperm till a
strange sort of insanity come over -PRON- and -PRON- find -PRON- unwittingly
squeeze -PRON- co laborer hand in -PRON- mistake -PRON- hand for the
gentle globule such an abounding affectionate friendly love
feeling do this avocation beget that at last -PRON- be continually
squeeze -PRON- hand and look up into -PRON- eye sentimentally as
much as to say oh -PRON- dear fellow being why should -PRON- longer cherish
any social acerbity or know the slight ill humor or envy come
let -PRON- squeeze hand all round nay let -PRON- all squeeze -PRON- into
each other let -PRON- squeeze -PRON- universally into the very milk and
sperm of kindness

would that -PRON- could keep squeeze that sperm for ever for now since by
many prolong repeat experience -PRON- have perceive that in all case
man must eventually lower or at least shift -PRON- conceit of attainable
felicity not place -PRON- anywhere in the intellect or the fancy but in
the wife the heart the bed the table the saddle the fireside the
country now that -PRON- have perceive all this -PRON- be ready to squeeze case
eternally in thought of the vision of the night -PRON- see long row of
angel in paradise each with -PRON- hand in a jar of spermaceti

now while discourse of sperm -PRON- behoove to speak of other thing
akin to -PRON- in the business of prepare the sperm whale for the
try work

first come white horse so call which be obtain from the taper
part of the fish and also from the thick portion of -PRON- fluke -PRON-
be tough with congealed tendon a wad of muscle but still contain
some oil after be sever from the whale the white horse be first
cut into portable oblong ere go to the mincer -PRON- look much like
block of berkshire marble

plum pudding be the term bestow upon certain fragmentary part of the
whale 's flesh here and there adhere to the blanket of blubber and
often participate to a considerable degree in -PRON- unctuousness -PRON- be
a most refreshing convivial beautiful object to behold as -PRON- name
import -PRON- be of an exceedingly rich mottled tint with a bestreaked
snowy and golden ground dot with spot of the deep crimson and
purple -PRON- be plum of ruby in picture of citron spite of reason
-PRON- be hard to keep -PRON- from eat -PRON- -PRON- confes that once -PRON- steal
behind the foremast to try -PRON- -PRON- taste something as -PRON- should conceive
a royal cutlet from the thigh of louis le gros may have taste
suppose -PRON- to have be kill the first day after the venison
season and that particular venison season contemporary with an
unusually fine vintage of the vineyard of champagne

there be another substance and a very singular one which turn up in
the course of this business but which -PRON- feel -PRON- to be very puzzling
adequately to describe -PRON- be call slobgollion an appellation
original with the whaleman and even so be the nature of the substance
-PRON- be an ineffably oozy stringy affair most frequently find in the
tub of sperm after a prolong squeezing and subsequent decanting
-PRON- hold -PRON- to be the wondrously thin ruptured membrane of the case
coalesce

gurry so call be a term properly belong to right whaleman but
sometimes incidentally use by the sperm fisherman -PRON- designate the
dark glutinous substance which be scrap off the back of the greenland
or right whale and much of which cover the deck of those inferior
soul who hunt that ignoble leviathan

nipper strictly this word be not indigenous to the whale 's vocabulary
but as apply by whaleman -PRON- become so a whaleman 's nipper be
a short firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the taper part of
leviathan 's tail -PRON- average an inch in thickness and for the rest be
about the size of the iron part of a hoe edgewise move along the
oily deck -PRON- operate like a leathern squilgee and by nameless
blandishment as of magic allure along with -PRON- all impurity

but to learn all about these recondite matter -PRON- good way be at once
to descend into the blubber room and have a long talk with -PRON- inmate
this place have previously be mention as the receptacle for the
blanket piece when stript and hoist from the whale when the proper
time arrive for cut up -PRON- content this apartment be a scene of
terror to all tiro especially by night on one side light by a dull
lantern a space have be leave clear for the workman -PRON- generally
go in pair a pike and gaffman and a spade man the whaling pike be
similar to a frigate 's boarding weapon of the same name the gaff be
something like a boat hook with -PRON- gaff the gaffman hook on to a
sheet of blubber and strive to hold -PRON- from slip as the ship
pitch and lurch about meanwhile the spade man stand on the sheet
-PRON- perpendicularly chop -PRON- into the portable horse piece this
spade be sharp as hone can make -PRON- the spademan 's foot be shoeless
the thing -PRON- stand on will sometimes irresistibly slide away from
-PRON- like a sledge if -PRON- cut off one of -PRON- own toe or one of -PRON-
assistant would -PRON- be very much astonish toe be scarce among
veteran blubber room man



chapter 95 the cassock


have -PRON- step on board the pequod at a certain juncture of this
post mortemizing of the whale and have -PRON- stroll forward nigh the
windlass pretty sure be -PRON- that -PRON- would have scan with no small
curiosity a very strange enigmatical object which -PRON- would have see
there lie along lengthwise in the lee scupper not the wondrous
cistern in the whale 's huge head not the prodigy of -PRON- unhinged low
jaw not the miracle of -PRON- symmetrical tail none of these would so
surprise -PRON- as half a glimpse of that unaccountable cone long than
a kentuckian be tall nigh a foot in diameter at the base and jet black
as yojo the ebony idol of queequeg and an idol indeed -PRON- be or
rather in old time -PRON- likeness be such an idol as that find in
the secret grove of queen maachah in judea and for worship which
king asa -PRON- son do depose -PRON- and destroy the idol and burn -PRON-
for an abomination at the brook kedron as darkly set forth in the 15th
chapter of the first book of king

look at the sailor call the mincer who now come along and assist
by two ally heavily back the grandissimus as the mariner call -PRON-
and with bowed shoulder stagger off with -PRON- as if -PRON- be a grenadi
carry a dead comrade from the field extend -PRON- upon the forecastle
deck -PRON- now proceed cylindrically to remove -PRON- dark pelt as an
african hunter the pelt of a boa this do -PRON- turn the pelt inside
out like a pantaloon leg give -PRON- a good stretching so as almost to
double -PRON- diameter and at last hang -PRON- well spread in the rigging
to dry ere long -PRON- be take down when remove some three foot of -PRON-
towards the pointed extremity and then cut two slit for arm hole
at the other end -PRON- lengthwise slip -PRON- bodily into -PRON- the mincer
now stand before -PRON- invest in the full canonical of -PRON- calling
immemorial to all -PRON- order this investiture alone will adequately
protect -PRON- while employ in the peculiar function of -PRON- office

that office consist in mince the horse piece of blubber for the
pot an operation which be conduct at a curious wooden horse plant
endwise against the bulwark and with a capacious tub beneath -PRON- into
which the minced piece drop fast as the sheet from a rapt orator 's
desk array in decent black occupy a conspicuous pulpit intent
on bible leaf what a candidate for an archbishopric what a lad for a
pope be this mincer


bible leaf bible leaf this be the invariable cry from the mate
to the mincer -PRON- enjoin -PRON- to be careful and cut -PRON- work into as
thin slice as possible inasmuch as by so do the business of
boil out the oil be much accelerate and -PRON- quantity considerably
increase besides perhaps improve -PRON- in quality



chapter 96 the try works


besides -PRON- hoist boat an american whaler be outwardly distinguished
by -PRON- try work -PRON- present the curious anomaly of the most solid
masonry join with oak and hemp in constitute the complete ship
-PRON- be as if from the open field a brick kiln be transport to -PRON-
plank

the try work be plant between the foremast and mainmast the most
roomy part of the deck the timber beneath be of a peculiar strength
fit to sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of brick and
mortar some ten foot by eight square and five in height the
foundation do not penetrate the deck but the masonry be firmly
secure to the surface by ponderous knee of iron brace -PRON- on all
side and screw -PRON- down to the timber on the flank -PRON- be case
with wood and at top completely cover by a large slop batten
hatchway remove this hatch -PRON- expose the great try pot two in
number and each of several barrel capacity when not in use -PRON- be
keep remarkably clean sometimes -PRON- be polished with soapstone
and sand till -PRON- shine within like silver punch bowl during the
night watch some cynical old sailor will crawl into -PRON- and coil
-PRON- away there for a nap while employ in polish -PRON- one
man in each pot side by side many confidential communication
be carry on over the iron lip -PRON- be a place also for profound
mathematical meditation -PRON- be in the left hand try pot of the pequod
with the soapstone diligently circle round -PRON- that -PRON- be first
indirectly strike by the remarkable fact that in geometry all body
glide along the cycloid -PRON- soapstone for example will descend from
any point in precisely the same time

remove the fire board from the front of the try work the bare
masonry of that side be expose penetrate by the two iron mouth of
the furnace directly underneath the pot these mouth be fit
with heavy door of iron the intense heat of the fire be prevent
from communicate -PRON- to the deck by mean of a shallow reservoir
extend under the entire inclosed surface of the work by a tunnel
insert at the rear this reservoir be keep replenish with water as
fast as -PRON- evaporate there be no external chimney -PRON- open direct
from the rear wall and here let -PRON- go back for a moment

-PRON- be about nine o'clock at night that the pequod 's try work be
first start on this present voyage -PRON- belong to stubb to oversee
the business

all ready there off hatch then and start -PRON- -PRON- cook fire the
work this be an easy thing for the carpenter have be thrust -PRON-
shaving into the furnace throughout the passage here be -PRON- say that
in a whaling voyage the first fire in the try work have to be feed for a
time with wood after that no wood be use except as a means of quick
ignition to the staple fuel in a word after be try out the
crisp shrivelled blubber now call scrap or fritter still contain
considerable of -PRON- unctuous property these fritter fee the flame
like a plethoric burn martyr or a self consume misanthrope once
ignite the whale supply -PRON- own fuel and burn by -PRON- own body
would that -PRON- consume -PRON- own smoke for -PRON- smoke be horrible to
inhale and inhale -PRON- -PRON- must and not only that but -PRON- must live in
-PRON- for the time -PRON- have an unspeakable wild hindoo odor about -PRON- such
as may lurk in the vicinity of funereal pyre -PRON- smell like the left
wing of the day of judgment -PRON- be an argument for the pit

by midnight the work be in full operation -PRON- be clear from the
carcase sail have be make the wind be freshen the wild ocean
darkness be intense but that darkness be lick up by the fierce
flame which at interval fork forth from the sooty flue and
illuminate every lofty rope in the rigging as with the famed greek
fire the burn ship drive on as if remorselessly commission to
some vengeful deed so the pitch and sulphur freight brig of the
bold hydriote canaris issue from -PRON- midnight harbor with broad
sheet of flame for sail bear down upon the turkish frigate and
fold -PRON- in conflagration

the hatch remove from the top of the work now afford a wide hearth
in front of -PRON- stand on this be the tartarean shape of the
pagan harpooneer always the whale ship 's stoker with huge pronged
pole -PRON- pitch hiss mass of blubber into the scalding pot or
stir up the fire beneath till the snaky flame dart curling out
of the door to catch -PRON- by the foot the smoke roll away in sullen
heap to every pitch of the ship there be a pitch of the boiling oil
which seem all eagerness to leap into -PRON- face opposite the mouth
of the work on the further side of the wide wooden hearth be the
windlass this serve for a sea sofa here lounge the watch when not
otherwise employ look into the red heat of the fire till -PRON-
eye feel scorch in -PRON- head -PRON- tawny feature now all
begrime with smoke and sweat -PRON- matted beard and the contrast
barbaric brilliancy of -PRON- tooth all these be strangely reveal in
the capricious emblazoning of the work as -PRON- narrate to each other
-PRON- unholy adventure -PRON- tale of terror tell in word of mirth
as -PRON- uncivilized laughter fork upwards out of -PRON- like the
flame from the furnace as to and fro in -PRON- front the harpooneer
wildly gesticulate with -PRON- huge pronged fork and dipper as the
wind howl on and the sea leap and the ship groan and dive and
yet steadfastly shoot -PRON- red hell further and further into the blackness
of the sea and the night and scornfully champ the white bone in
-PRON- mouth and viciously spit round -PRON- on all side then the rush
pequod freight with savage and lade with fire and burn
a corpse and plunge into that blackness of darkness seem the
material counterpart of -PRON- monomaniac commander 's soul

so seem -PRON- to -PRON- as -PRON- stand at -PRON- helm and for long hour silently
guide the way of this fire ship on the sea wrap for that interval
in darkness -PRON- -PRON- but the good see the redness the madness the
ghastliness of other the continual sight of the fiend shape before
-PRON- caper half in smoke and half in fire these at last beget kindred
vision in -PRON- soul so soon as -PRON- begin to yield to that unaccountable
drowsiness which ever would come over -PRON- at a midnight helm

but that night in particular a strange and ever since inexplicable
thing occur to -PRON- start from a brief standing sleep -PRON- be
horribly conscious of something fatally wrong the jaw bone tiller smite
-PRON- side which lean against -PRON- in -PRON- ear be the low hum of sail
just begin to shake in the wind -PRON- think -PRON- eye be open -PRON-
be half conscious of put -PRON- finger to the lid and mechanically
stretch -PRON- still further apart but spite of all this -PRON- could see
no compass before -PRON- to steer by though -PRON- seem but a minute since -PRON-
have be watch the card by the steady binnacle lamp illuminate -PRON-
nothing seem before -PRON- but a jet gloom now and then make ghastly by
flash of redness uppermost be the impression that whatev swift
rush thing -PRON- stand on be not so much bind to any haven ahead as
rush from all haven astern a stark bewildered feeling as of
death come over -PRON- convulsively -PRON- hand grasp the tiller but with
the crazy conceit that the tiller be somehow in some enchanted way
inverted -PRON- god what be the matter with -PRON- think i. lo in -PRON- brief
sleep -PRON- have turn -PRON- about and be front the ship 's stern with
-PRON- back to -PRON- prow and the compass in an instant -PRON- face back just
in time to prevent the vessel from fly up into the wind and very
probably capsize -PRON- how glad and how grateful the relief from this
unnatural hallucination of the night and the fatal contingency of be
bring by the lee

look not too long in the face of the fire o man never dream with thy
hand on the helm turn not thy back to the compass accept the first
hint of the hitch tiller believe not the artificial fire when -PRON-
redness make all thing look ghastly to morrow in the natural sun
the sky will be bright those who glare like devil in the forking
flame the morn will show in far other at least gentler relief the
glorious golden glad sun the only true lamp all other but liar

nevertheless the sun hide not virginia 's dismal swamp nor rome 's
accurse campagna nor wide sahara nor all the million of mile of
desert and of griefs beneath the moon the sun hide not the ocean
which be the dark side of this earth and which be two third of this
earth so therefore that mortal man who hath more of joy than sorrow
in -PRON- that mortal man can not be true not true or undeveloped with
book the same the true of all man be the man of sorrows and the
true of all book be solomon 's and ecclesiastes be the fine hammer
steel of woe all be vanity all this wilful world hath not get hold
of unchristian solomon 's wisdom yet but -PRON- who dodge hospital and
jail and walk fast cross graveyard and would rather talk of
opera than hell call cowper young pascal rousseau poor devil all
of sick man and throughout a care free lifetime swear by rabelais as
pass wise and therefore jolly not that man be fit to sit
down on tomb stone and break the green damp mould with unfathomably
wondrous solomon

but even solomon -PRON- say the man that wandereth out of the way
of understanding shall remain i.e. even while live in the
congregation of the dead give not thyself up then to fire lest -PRON-
invert thee deaden thee as for the time -PRON- do -PRON- there be a wisdom
that be woe but there be a woe that be madness and there be a catskill
eagle in some soul that can alike dive down into the blackest gorge
and soar out of -PRON- again and become invisible in the sunny space
and even if -PRON- for ever fly within the gorge that gorge be in the
mountain so that even in -PRON- low swoop the mountain eagle be still
high than other bird upon the plain even though -PRON- soar



chapter 97 the lamp


have -PRON- descend from the pequod 's try work to the pequod 's
forecastle where the off duty watch be sleep for one single
moment -PRON- would have almost think -PRON- be stand in some
illuminate shrine of canonize king and counsellor there -PRON- lie
in -PRON- triangular oaken vault each mariner a chiselled muteness a
score of lamp flash upon -PRON- hooded eye

in merchantman oil for the sailor be more scarce than the milk of
queen to dress in the dark and eat in the dark and stumble in
darkness to -PRON- pallet this be -PRON- usual lot but the whaleman as -PRON-
seek the food of light so -PRON- live in light -PRON- make -PRON- berth an
aladdin 's lamp and lay -PRON- down in -PRON- so that in the pitchiest night
the ship 's black hull still house an illumination

see with what entire freedom the whaleman take -PRON- handful of
lamp often but old bottle and vial though to the copper cooler at
the try work and replenish -PRON- there as mug of ale at a vat -PRON-
burn too the pure of oil in -PRON- unmanufactured and therefore
unvitiated state a fluid unknown to solar lunar or astral
contrivance ashore -PRON- be sweet as early grass butter in april -PRON-
go and hunt for -PRON- oil so as to be sure of -PRON- freshness and
genuineness even as the traveller on the prairie hunt up -PRON- own
supper of game



chapter 98 stow down and clear up


already have -PRON- be relate how the great leviathan be afar off
descry from the mast head how -PRON- be chase over the watery moor and
slaughter in the valley of the deep how -PRON- be then tow alongside
and behead and how on the principle which entitle the headsman of
old to the garment in which the behead be kill -PRON- great padded
surtout become the property of -PRON- executioner how in due time -PRON-
be condemn to the pot and like shadrach meshach and abednego -PRON-
spermaceti oil and bone pass unscath through the fire but now -PRON-
remain to conclude the last chapter of this part of the description by
rehearsing singing if -PRON- may the romantic proceeding of decant off
-PRON- oil into the cask and strike -PRON- down into the hold where
once again leviathan return to -PRON- native profundity slide along
beneath the surface as before but alas never more to rise and blow

while still warm the oil like hot punch be receive into the
six barrel cask and while perhaps the ship be pitch and roll
this way and that in the midnight sea the enormous cask be slew
round and head over end for end and sometimes perilously scoot
across the slippery deck like so many land slide till at last
man handle and stay in -PRON- course and all round the hoop rap
rap go as many hammer as can play upon -PRON- for now ex officio
every sailor be a cooper

at length when the last pint be cask and all be cool then the great
hatchway be unseal the bowel of the ship be throw open and down
go the cask to -PRON- final rest in the sea this do the hatch be
replace and hermetically close like a closet wall up

in the sperm fishery this be perhaps one of the most remarkable
incident in all the business of whaling one day the plank stream with
freshet of blood and oil on the sacred quarter deck enormous mass of
the whale 's head be profanely pile great rusty cask lie about as
in a brewery yard the smoke from the try work have besoot all the
bulwark the mariner go about suffuse with unctuousness the entire
ship seem great leviathan -PRON- while on all hand the din be
deafen

but a day or two after -PRON- look about -PRON- and prick -PRON- ear in this
self same ship and be -PRON- not for the tell tale boat and try work
-PRON- would all but swear -PRON- tread some silent merchant vessel with a
most scrupulously neat commander the unmanufactured sperm oil possess
a singularly cleansing virtue this be the reason why the deck never
look so white as just after what -PRON- call an affair of oil besides
from the ash of the burn scrap of the whale a potent lye be
readily make and whenever any adhesiveness from the back of the whale
remain cling to the side that lye quickly exterminate -PRON- hand
go diligently along the bulwark and with bucket of water and rag
restore -PRON- to -PRON- full tidiness the soot be brush from the low
rig all the numerous implement which have be in use be likewise
faithfully cleanse and put away the great hatch be scrub and place
upon the try work completely hide the pot every cask be out of
sight all tackle be coil in unseen nook and when by the combine
and simultaneous industry of almost the entire ship 's company the
whole of this conscientious duty be at last conclude then the crew
-PRON- proce to -PRON- own ablution shift -PRON- from top to
toe and finally issue to the immaculate deck fresh and all aglow as
bridegroom new leap from out the dainty holland

now with elated step -PRON- pace the plank in two and three and
humorously discourse of parlor sofas carpet and fine cambric
propose to mat the deck think of have hang to the top object not
to take tea by moonlight on the piazza of the forecastle to hint to
such musked mariner of oil and bone and blubber be little short
of audacity -PRON- know not the thing -PRON- distantly allude to away and
bring -PRON- napkin

but mark aloft there at the three mast head stand three man intent
on spy out more whale which if catch infallibly will again
soil the old oaken furniture and drop at least one small grease spot
somewhere yes and many be the time when after the severe
uninterrupted labor which know no night continue straight through
for ninety six hour when from the boat where -PRON- have swell -PRON-
wrist with all day row on the line -PRON- only step to the deck to
carry vast chain and heave the heavy windlass and cut and slash yea
and in -PRON- very sweating to be smoke and burn anew by the combine
fire of the equatorial sun and the equatorial try work when on the
heel of all this -PRON- have finally bestir -PRON- to cleanse the
ship and make a spotless dairy room of -PRON- many be the time the poor
fellow just button the neck of -PRON- clean frock be startle by
the cry of there -PRON- blow and away -PRON- fly to fight another whale
and go through the whole weary thing again oh -PRON- friend but this
be man kill yet this be life for hardly have -PRON- mortal by long
toiling extract from this world 's vast bulk -PRON- small but valuable
sperm and then with weary patience cleanse -PRON- from -PRON-
defilement and learn to live here in clean tabernacle of the soul
hardly be this do when there she blows!--the ghost be spout up
and away -PRON- sail to fight some other world and go through young life 's
old routine again

oh the metempsychosis oh pythagoras that in bright greece two
thousand year ago do die so good so wise so mild -PRON- sail with
thee along the peruvian coast last voyage and foolish as -PRON- be teach
thee a green simple boy how to splice a rope



chapter 99 the doubloon


ere now -PRON- have be relate how ahab be will not to pace -PRON- quarter deck
take regular turn at either limit the binnacle and mainmast but
in the multiplicity of other thing require narration -PRON- have not be
add how that sometimes in these walk when most plunge in -PRON- mood
-PRON- be will not to pause in turn at each spot and stand there strangely
eye the particular object before -PRON- when -PRON- halt before the
binnacle with -PRON- glance fastened on the pointed needle in the compass
that glance shoot like a javelin with the pointed intensity of -PRON-
purpose and when resume -PRON- walk -PRON- again pause before the mainmast
then as the same rivet glance fasten upon the riveted gold coin
there -PRON- still wear the same aspect of nailed firmness only dash
with a certain wild longing if not hopefulness

but one morning turn to pass the doubloon -PRON- seem to be newly
attract by the strange figure and inscription stamp on -PRON- as
though now for the first time begin to interpret for -PRON- in
some monomaniac way whatev significance may lurk in -PRON- and some
certain significance lurk in all thing else all thing be little
worth and the round world -PRON- but an empty cipher except to sell by
the cartload as -PRON- do hill about boston to fill up some morass in
the milky way

now this doubloon be of pure virgin gold rake somewhere out of the
heart of gorgeous hill whence east and west over golden sand the
head water of many a pactolus flow and though now nail amidst all
the rustiness of iron bolt and the verdigris of copper spike yet
untouchable and immaculate to any foulness -PRON- still preserve -PRON- quito
glow nor though place amongst a ruthless crew and every hour pass
by ruthless hand and through the livelong night shroud with thick
darkness which may cover any pilfering approach nevertheless every
sunrise find the doubloon where the sunset leave -PRON- last for -PRON- be
set apart and sanctified to one awe strike end and however wanton
in -PRON- sailor way one and all the mariner revere -PRON- as the white
whale 's talisman sometimes -PRON- talk -PRON- over in the weary watch by
night wonder whose -PRON- be to be at last and whether -PRON- would ever
live to spend -PRON-

now those noble golden coin of south america be as medal of the sun
and tropic token piece here palm alpacas and volcano sun 's disk
and star ecliptic horn of plenty and rich banner wave be in
luxuriant profusion stamp so that the precious gold seem almost to
derive an add preciousness and enhance glory by pass through
those fancy mint so spanishly poetic

of these thing on -PRON- round border -PRON- bear the letter republica del
ecuador quito so this bright coin come from a country plant in the
middle of the world and beneath the great equator and name after -PRON-

captain who be carelessly recline in -PRON- own boat 's bow -PRON- be
a darkly tan burly good natured fine look man of sixty or
thereabout dress in a spacious roundabout that hang round -PRON- in
festoon of blue pilot cloth and one empty arm of this jacket stream
behind -PRON- like the broidered arm of a hussar 's surcoat

-PRON- hold up a white arm of sperm whale bone terminate in a wooden head
like a mallet

him--"stand by to lower

in less than a minute without quit -PRON- little craft -PRON- and -PRON-
crew be drop to the water and be soon alongside of the stranger
but here a curious difficulty present -PRON- in the excitement of the
moment ahab have forget that since the loss of -PRON- leg -PRON- have never
once step on board of any vessel at sea but -PRON- own and then -PRON- be
always by an ingenious and very handy mechanical contrivance peculiar to
the pequod and a thing not to be rig and ship in any other
vessel at a moment 's warning now -PRON- be no very easy matter
for anybody except those who be almost hourly use to -PRON- like
whaleman to clamber up a ship 's side from a boat on the open sea for
the great swell now lift the boat high up towards the bulwark and
then instantaneously drop -PRON- half way down to the kelson so deprive
of one leg and the strange ship of course be altogether unsuppli
with the kindly invention ahab now find -PRON- abjectly reduce to a
clumsy landsman again hopelessly eye the uncertain changeful height
-PRON- could hardly hope to attain

-PRON- have before be hint perhaps that every little untoward
circumstance that befall -PRON- and which indirectly spring from -PRON-
luckless mishap almost invariably irritate or exasperate ahab and
in the present instance all this be heighten by the sight of the
two officer of the strange ship lean over the side by the
perpendicular ladder of nail cleet there and swing towards -PRON- a
pair of tastefully ornamented man rope for at first -PRON- do not seem
to bethink -PRON- that a one legg man must be too much of a cripple to
use -PRON- sea bannister but this awkwardness only last a minute
because the strange captain observe at a glance how affair stand
cry out -PRON- see -PRON- see!--avast heave there jump boy and swing
over the cutting tackle

as good luck would have -PRON- -PRON- have have a whale alongside a day or two
previous and the great tackle be still aloft and the massive curved
blubber hook now clean and dry be still attach to the end this
be quickly lower to ahab who at once comprehend -PRON- all slide -PRON-
solitary thigh into the curve of the hook -PRON- be like sit in the
fluke of an anchor or the crotch of an apple tree and then give the
word hold -PRON- fast and at the same time also help to hoist -PRON-
own weight by pull hand over hand upon one of the run part of
the tackle soon -PRON- be carefully swing inside the high bulwark and
gently land upon the capstan head with -PRON- ivory arm frankly thrust
forth in welcome the other captain advance and ahab put out -PRON-
ivory leg and cross the ivory arm like two sword fish blade
cry out in -PRON- walrus way aye aye hearty let -PRON- shake bone
together!--an arm and a leg!--an arm that never can shrink d'ye
see and a leg that never can run where did'st thou see the white
whale how long ago

the white whale say the englishman point -PRON- ivory arm towards
the east and take a rueful sight along -PRON- as if -PRON- have be a
telescope there -PRON- see -PRON- on the line last season

and -PRON- take that arm off do -PRON- ask ahab now slide down from
the capstan and rest on the englishman 's shoulder as -PRON- do so

fluk first the white hump back through the wreck as though -PRON- be
all chip -PRON- all strike out to escape -PRON- terrible flailing -PRON- seize
hold of -PRON- harpoon pole sticking in -PRON- and for a moment clung to that
like a suck fish but a combing sea dash -PRON- off and at the same
instant the fish take one good dart forward go down like a
flash and the barb of that curse second iron towing along near -PRON-
catch -PRON- here clap -PRON- hand just below -PRON- shoulder yes
catch -PRON- just here -PRON- say and bear -PRON- down to hell 's flame -PRON- be

gentlemanly rank on board -PRON- face be an exceedingly round but sober
one -PRON- be dress in a fade blue woollen frock or shirt and patch
trowser and have thus far be divide -PRON- attention between a
marlingspike -PRON- hold in one hand and a pill box hold in the other
occasionally cast a critical glance at the ivory limb of the two
crippled captain but at -PRON- superior 's introduction of -PRON- to ahab

oh very severe chime in the patient -PRON- then suddenly alter
-PRON- voice drink hot rum toddy with -PRON- every night till -PRON-
could not see to put on the bandage and send -PRON- to bed half sea
over about three o'clock in the morning oh ye star -PRON- sit up with
-PRON- indeed and be very severe in -PRON- diet oh a great watcher and very
dietetically severe be dr. bunger bunger -PRON- dog laugh out why
do not ye -PRON- know -PRON- be a precious jolly rascal but heave ahead
boy -PRON- would rather be kill by -PRON- than keep alive by any other man

-PRON- captain -PRON- must have ere this perceive respect sir say the
imperturbable godly look bunger slightly bow to ahab--"is apt to
be facetious at time -PRON- spin -PRON- many clever thing of that sort but
-PRON- may as well say en passant as the french remark that -PRON- -PRON- that
be to say jack bunger late of the reverend clergy be a strict total
abstinence man -PRON- never drink--

water cry the captain -PRON- never drink -PRON- -PRON- be a sort of fit to
-PRON- fresh water throw -PRON- into the hydrophobia but go on go on with
the arm story

yes -PRON- may as well say the surgeon coolly -PRON- be about observe
sir before captain boomer 's facetious interruption that spite of -PRON-
good and severe endeavor the wound keep get bad and bad the
truth be sir -PRON- be as ugly gaping wound as surgeon ever see more

against all rule point at -PRON- with the marlingspike--"that be the
captain 's work not mine -PRON- order the carpenter to make -PRON- -PRON- have
that club hammer there put to the end to knock some one 's brain
out with -PRON- suppose as -PRON- try mine once -PRON- fly into diabolical
passion sometimes do ye see this dent sir remove -PRON- hat and
brush aside -PRON- hair and expose a bowl like cavity in -PRON- skull
but which bear not the slight scarry trace or any token of ever
have be a wound--"well the captain there will tell -PRON- how that
come here -PRON- know

what became of the white whale now cry ahab who thus far have be
impatiently listen to this by play between the two englishman

oh cry the one armed captain oh yes well after -PRON- sound
-PRON- do not see -PRON- again for some time in fact as -PRON- before hint -PRON-
do not then know what whale -PRON- be that have serve -PRON- such a trick till
some time afterwards when come back to the line -PRON- hear about moby
dick as some call -PRON- and then -PRON- know -PRON- be -PRON-

did'st thou cros -PRON- wake again

twice

but could not fasten

do n't want to try to be not one limb enough what should -PRON- do without
this other arm and -PRON- be think moby dick do not bite so much as -PRON-
swallow

well then interrupt bunger give -PRON- -PRON- left arm for bait to
get the right do -PRON- know gentleman very gravely and mathematically
bow to each captain in succession--"do -PRON- know gentleman that the
digestive organ of the whale be so inscrutably construct by divine
providence that -PRON- be quite impossible for -PRON- to completely digest
even a man 's arm and -PRON- know -PRON- too so that what -PRON- take for the
white whale 's malice be only -PRON- awkwardness for -PRON- never mean
to swallow a single limb -PRON- only think to terrify by feint but
sometimes -PRON- be like the old juggling fellow formerly a patient of mine
in ceylon that make believe swallow jack knife once upon a time let
one drop into -PRON- in good earnest and there -PRON- stay for a twelvemonth
or more when -PRON- give -PRON- an emetic and -PRON- heave -PRON- up in small tack
d'ye see no possible way for -PRON- to digest that jack knife and fully
incorporate -PRON- into -PRON- general bodily system yes captain boomer if
-PRON- be quick enough about -PRON- and have a mind to pawn one arm for the
sake of the privilege of give decent burial to the other why in that
case the arm be -PRON- only let the whale have another chance at -PRON-
shortly that be all

no thank ye bunger say the english captain -PRON- be welcome to the
arm -PRON- have since -PRON- can not help -PRON- and do not know -PRON- then but not to
another one no more white whales for -PRON- -PRON- have lower for -PRON- once and
that have satisfy -PRON- there would be great glory in kill -PRON- -PRON- know
that and there be a ship load of precious sperm in -PRON- but hark ye
-PRON- be good let alone do not -PRON- think so captain glance at the
ivory leg

-PRON- be but -PRON- will still be hunt for all that what be good let
alone that accursed thing be not always what least allure -PRON- be all a
magnet how long since thou saw'st -PRON- last which way head

bless -PRON- soul and curse the foul fiend 's cry bunger stoopingly
walk round ahab and like a dog strangely snuff this man 's
blood bring the thermometer!--it 's at the boiling point!--his pulse
make these plank beat!--sir!"--tak a lancet from -PRON- pocket and
draw near to ahab 's arm

avast roar ahab dash -PRON- against the bulwarks--"man the boat
which way head

good god cry the english captain to whom the question be put
what be the matter -PRON- be head east -PRON- think be -PRON- captain
crazy whisper fedallah

but fedallah put a finger on -PRON- lip slide over the bulwark to
take the boat 's steering oar and ahab swing the cutting tackle
towards -PRON- command the ship 's sailor to stand by to lower

in a moment -PRON- be stand in the boat 's stern and the manilla man
be spring to -PRON- oar in vain the english captain hail -PRON-
with back to the stranger ship and face set like a flint to -PRON- own
ahab stand upright till alongside of the pequod

enderby sons a house which in -PRON- poor whaleman 's opinion come not
far behind the united royal house of the tudors and bourbons in point
of real historical interest how long prior to the year of -PRON-
lord 1775 this great whaling house be in existence -PRON- numerous
fish document do not make plain but in that year 1775 -PRON- fit
out the first english ship that ever regularly hunt the sperm whale
though for some score of year previous ever since 1726 -PRON- valiant
coffin and maceys of nantucket and the vineyard have in large fleet
pursue that leviathan but only in the north and south atlantic not
elsewhere be -PRON- distinctly record here that the nantucketers be
the first among mankind to harpoon with civilized steel the great sperm
whale and that for half a century -PRON- be the only people of the
whole globe who so harpoon -PRON-

in 1778 a fine ship the amelia fit out for the express purpose
and at the sole charge of the vigorous enderbys boldly round cape
horn and be the first among the nation to lower a whale boat of any
sort in the great south sea the voyage be a skilful and lucky one
and return to -PRON- berth with -PRON- hold full of the precious sperm the
amelia 's example be soon follow by other ship english and american
and thus the vast sperm whale ground of the pacific be throw open
but not content with this good deed the indefatigable house again
bestir -PRON- samuel and all -PRON- son how many -PRON- mother only
know and under -PRON- immediate auspex and partly -PRON- think at -PRON-
expense the british government be induce to send the sloop of war
rattler on a whaling voyage of discovery into the south sea command
by a naval post captain the rattler make a rattle voyage of -PRON- and
do some service how much do not appear but this be not all in
1819 the same house fit out a discovery whale ship of -PRON- own to
go on a taste cruise to the remote water of japan that ship well
call the syren make a noble experimental cruise and -PRON- be thus
that the great japanese whaling ground first become generally know
the syren in this famous voyage be command by a captain coffin a
nantucketer

all honour to the enderbies therefore whose house -PRON- think exist to
the present day though doubtless the original samuel must long ago have
slip -PRON- cable for the great south sea of the other world

the ship name after -PRON- be worthy of the honour be a very fast
sailer and a noble craft every way -PRON- board -PRON- once at midnight
somewhere off the patagonian coast and drank good flip down in the
forecastle -PRON- be a fine gam -PRON- have and -PRON- be all trump every
soul on board a short life to -PRON- and a jolly death and that fine
gam -PRON- have long very long after old ahab touch -PRON- plank with -PRON-
ivory heel -PRON- mind -PRON- of the noble solid saxon hospitality of that
ship and may -PRON- parson forget -PRON- and the devil remember -PRON- if -PRON- ever
lose sight of -PRON- flip do -PRON- say -PRON- have flip yes and -PRON- flip -PRON-
at the rate of ten gallon the hour and when the squall come for -PRON- be
squally off there by patagonia and all hand visitor and all be
call to reef topsail -PRON- be so top heavy that -PRON- have to swing each
other aloft in bowline and -PRON- ignorantly furl the skirt of -PRON-
jacket into the sail so that -PRON- hang there reef fast in the
howl gale a warning example to all drunken tar however the mast
do not go overboard and by and by -PRON- scramble down so sober that -PRON-
have to pass the flip again though the savage salt spray burst down
the forecastle scuttle rather too much diluted and pickled -PRON- to -PRON-
taste

the beef be fine tough but with body in -PRON- -PRON- say -PRON- be
bull beef other that -PRON- be dromedary beef but -PRON- do not know for
certain how that be -PRON- have dumpling too small but substantial
symmetrically globular and indestructible dumpling -PRON- fancy that -PRON-
could feel -PRON- and roll -PRON- about in -PRON- after -PRON- be swallow
if -PRON- stoop over too far forward -PRON- risk -PRON- pitch out
of -PRON- like billiard ball the bread but that could not be help
besides -PRON- be an anti scorbutic in short the bread contain the
only fresh fare -PRON- have but the forecastle be not very light and -PRON-
be very easy to step over into a dark corner when -PRON- eat -PRON- but all
in all take -PRON- from truck to helm consider the dimension of the
cook 's boiler include -PRON- own live parchment boiler fore and aft
-PRON- say the samuel enderby be a jolly ship of good fare and plenty
fine flip and strong crack fellow all and capital from boot heel to
hat band

but why be -PRON- think ye that the samuel enderby and some other
english whaler -PRON- know of not all though be such famous hospitable
ship that pass round the beef and the bread and the can and the
joke and be not soon weary of eat and drinking and laugh
-PRON- will tell -PRON- the abound good cheer of these english whaler
be matter for historical research nor have -PRON- be at all spar of
historical whale research when -PRON- have seem need

the english be precede in the whale fishery by the hollanders
zealander and danes from whom -PRON- derive many term still extant
in the fishery and what be yet more -PRON- fat old fashion
touch plenty to eat and drink for as a general thing the english
merchant ship scrimp -PRON- crew but not so the english whaler hence in
the english this thing of whale good cheer be not normal and natural
but incidental and particular and therefore must have some special
origin which be here point out and will be still further elucidate

during -PRON- research in the leviathanic history -PRON- stumble upon an
ancient dutch volume which by the musty whaling smell of -PRON- -PRON-
know must be about whaler the title be dan coopman wherefore -PRON-
conclude that this must be the invaluable memoir of some amsterdam
cooper in the fishery as every whale ship must carry -PRON- cooper -PRON- be
reinforce in this opinion by see that -PRON- be the production of one
fitz swackhammer but -PRON- friend dr. snodhead a very learn man
professor of low dutch and high german in the college of santa claus and
st. pott 's to whom -PRON- hand the work for translation give -PRON- a box
of sperm candle for -PRON- trouble this same dr. snodhead so soon as -PRON-
spy the book assure -PRON- that dan coopman do not mean the cooper
but the merchant in short this ancient and learn low dutch book
treat of the commerce of holland and among other subject contain
a very interesting account of -PRON- whale fishery and in this chapter -PRON-
be head smeer or fat that -PRON- find a long detail list of the
outfit for the larder and cellar of 180 sail of dutch whaleman from
which list as translate by dr. snodhead -PRON- transcribe the follow

400,000 lbs of beef 60,000 lbs friesland pork 150,000 lbs of stock
fish 550,000 lbs of biscuit 72,000 lbs of soft bread 2,800 firkin
of butter 20,000 lbs texel leyden cheese 144,000 lbs cheese
probably an inferior article 550 anker of geneva 10,800 barrel of
beer

most statistical table be parchingly dry in the reading not so in
the present case however where the reader be flood with whole pipe
barrel quart and gill of good gin and good cheer

at the time -PRON- devote three day to the studious digesting of all
this beer beef and bread during which many profound thought be
incidentally suggest to -PRON- capable of a transcendental and platonic
application and furthermore -PRON- compile supplementary table of -PRON-
own touch the probable quantity of stock fish etc consume by
every low dutch harpooneer in that ancient greenland and spitzbergen
whale fishery in the first place the amount of butter and texel and
leyden cheese consume seem amazing -PRON- impute -PRON- though to -PRON-
naturally unctuous nature be render still more unctuous by the
nature of -PRON- vocation and especially by -PRON- pursue -PRON- game
in those frigid polar seas on the very coast of that esquimaux country
where the convivial native pledge each other in bumper of train oil

the quantity of beer too be very large 10,800 barrel now as those
polar fishery could only be prosecute in the short summer of that
climate so that the whole cruise of one of these dutch whaleman
include the short voyage to and from the spitzbergen sea do not much
exce three month say and reckon 30 man to each of -PRON- fleet
of 180 sail -PRON- have 5,400 low dutch seamen in all therefore -PRON- say
-PRON- have precisely two barrel of beer per man for a twelve week
allowance exclusive of -PRON- fair proportion of that 550 anker of gin
now whether these gin and beer harpooneer so fuddled as one may
fancy -PRON- to have be be the right sort of man to stand up in
a boat 's head and take good aim at fly whale this would seem
somewhat improbable yet -PRON- do aim at -PRON- and hit -PRON- too but
this be very far north be -PRON- remember where beer agree well with
the constitution upon the equator in -PRON- southern fishery beer would
be apt to make the harpooneer sleepy at the mast head and boozy in -PRON-
boat and grievous loss may ensue to nantucket and new bedford

but no more enough have be say to show that the old dutch whaler
of two or three century ago be high liver and that the english
whaler have not neglect so excellent an example for say -PRON- when
cruise in an empty ship if -PRON- can get nothing good out of the
world get a good dinner out of -PRON- at least and this empty the
decanter



chapter 102 a bower in the arsacides


hitherto in descriptively treat of the sperm whale -PRON- have chiefly
dwell upon the marvel of -PRON- outer aspect or separately and in detail
upon some few interior structural feature but to a large and thorough
sweeping comprehension of -PRON- -PRON- behoove -PRON- now to unbutton -PRON- still
further and untagg the point of -PRON- hose unbuckle -PRON- garter
and cast loose the hook and the eye of the joint of -PRON- innermost
bone set -PRON- before -PRON- in -PRON- ultimatum that be to say in -PRON-
unconditional skeleton

but how now ishmael how be -PRON- that -PRON- a mere oarsman in the
fishery pretend to know aught about the subterranean part of the
whale do erudite stubb mount upon -PRON- capstan deliver lecture
on the anatomy of the cetacea and by help of the windlass hold up a
specimen rib for exhibition explain thyself ishmael can -PRON- land
a full grown whale on -PRON- deck for examination as a cook dish a
roast pig surely not a veritable witness have -PRON- hitherto be
ishmael but have a care how -PRON- seize the privilege of jonah alone
the privilege of discourse upon the joist and beam the rafter
ridge pole sleeper and under pinning make up the frame work of
leviathan and belike of the tallow vat dairy room buttery and
cheeserie in -PRON- bowel

-PRON- confes that since jonah few whaleman have penetrate very far
beneath the skin of the adult whale nevertheless -PRON- have be bless
with an opportunity to dissect -PRON- in miniature in a ship -PRON- belong
to a small cub sperm whale be once bodily hoist to the deck for -PRON-
poke or bag to make sheath for the barb of the harpoon and for the
head of the lance think -PRON- -PRON- let that chance go without use -PRON-
boat hatchet and jack knife and break the seal and read all the
content of that young cub

and as for -PRON- exact knowledge of the bone of the leviathan in -PRON-
gigantic full grown development for that rare knowledge -PRON- be indebted
to -PRON- late royal friend tranquo king of tranque one of the arsacides
for be at tranque year ago when attach to the trading ship dey
of algiers -PRON- be invite to spend part of the arsacidean holiday with
the lord of tranque at -PRON- retired palm villa at pupella a sea side
glen not very far distant from what -PRON- sailor call bamboo town -PRON-
capital

among many other fine quality -PRON- royal friend tranquo be gift
with a devout love for all matter of barbaric vertu have bring
together in pupella whatev rare thing the more ingenious of -PRON-
people could invent chiefly carve wood of wonderful device
chiselled shell inlaid spear costly paddle aromatic canoe
and all these distribute among whatev natural wonder the
wonder freight tribute render wave have cast upon -PRON- shore

chief among these latter be a great sperm whale which after an
unusually long rag gale have be find dead and strand with -PRON-
head against a cocoa nut tree whose plumage like tufted drooping
seem -PRON- verdant jet when the vast body have at last be strip of
-PRON- fathom deep enfolding and the bone become dust dry in the sun
then the skeleton be carefully transport up the pupella glen where a
grand temple of lordly palm now shelter -PRON-

the rib be hang with trophy the vertebra be carve with
arsacidean annal in strange hieroglyphic in the skull the priest
keep up an unextinguished aromatic flame so that the mystic head
again send forth -PRON- vapoury spout while suspend from a bough the
terrific low jaw vibrate over all the devotee like the hair hang
sword that so affrighted damocles

-PRON- be a wondrous sight the wood be green as moss of the icy
glen the tree stand high and haughty feel -PRON- live sap the
industrious earth beneath be as a weaver 's loom with a gorgeous carpet
on -PRON- whereof the ground vine tendril form the warp and woof and
the live flower the figure all the tree with all -PRON- laden
branch all the shrub and fern and grass the message carry
air all these unceasingly be active through the lacing of the
leaf the great sun seem a fly shuttle weave the unwearied
verdure oh busy weaver unseen weaver!--pause!--one word!--whither
flow the fabric what palace may -PRON- deck wherefore all these ceaseless
toiling speak weaver!--stay thy hand!--but one single word with
thee nay the shuttle fly the figure float from forth the loom the
freshet rush carpet for ever slide away the weaver god -PRON- weave
and by that weaving be -PRON- deafen that -PRON- hear no mortal voice and
by that humming -PRON- too who look on the loom be deafen and only
when -PRON- escape -PRON- shall -PRON- hear the thousand voice that speak through
-PRON- for even so -PRON- be in all material factory the speak word that
be inaudible among the fly spindle those same word be plainly
hear without the wall burst from the open casement thereby
have villainy be detect ah mortal then be heedful for so in
all this din of the great world 's loom thy subtle thinking may be
overheard afar

now amid the green life restless loom of that arsacidean wood the
great white worship skeleton lie lounge a gigantic idler yet
as the ever weave verdant warp and woof intermixed and hum around
-PRON- the mighty idler seem the cunning weaver -PRON- all weave
over with the vine every month assume green fresher verdure but
-PRON- a skeleton life fold death death trellis life the grim
god wive with youthful life and beget -PRON- curly head glory

now when with royal tranquo -PRON- visit this wondrous whale and see the
skull an altar and the artificial smoke ascend from where the real
jet have issue -PRON- marvel that the king should regard a chapel as
an object of vertu -PRON- laugh but more -PRON- marvel that the priest
should swear that smoky jet of -PRON- be genuine to and fro -PRON- pace
before this skeleton brush the vine aside break through the
rib and with a ball of arsacidean twine wander eddy long amid
-PRON- many winding shade colonnade and arbour but soon -PRON- line be
out and follow -PRON- back -PRON- emerge from the opening where -PRON- enter
-PRON- see no living thing within naught be there but bone

cut -PRON- a green measuring rod -PRON- once more dive within the skeleton
from -PRON- arrow slit in the skull the priest perceive -PRON- take the
altitude of the final rib how now -PRON- shout dar'st thou measure
this -PRON- god that be for -PRON- aye priest well how long do ye make
-PRON- then but hereupon a fierce contest rise among -PRON- concern
foot and inch -PRON- crack each other 's sconce with -PRON-
yard stick the great skull echoed and seize that lucky chance -PRON-
quickly conclude -PRON- own admeasurement

these admeasurement -PRON- now propose to set before -PRON- but first be
-PRON- record that in this matter -PRON- be not free to utter any fancied
measurement -PRON- please because there be skeleton authority -PRON- can
refer to to test -PRON- accuracy there be a leviathanic museum -PRON- tell
-PRON- in hull england one of the whaling port of that country where
-PRON- have some fine specimen of fin back and other whale likewise -PRON-
have hear that in the museum of manchester in new hampshire -PRON- have
what the proprietor call the only perfect specimen of a greenland or
river whale in the united states moreover at a place in yorkshire
england burton constable by name a certain sir clifford constable have
in -PRON- possession the skeleton of a sperm whale but of moderate size
by no mean of the full grown magnitude of -PRON- friend king tranquo 's

in both case the strand whale to which these two skeleton
belong be originally claim by -PRON- proprietor upon similar
ground king tranquo seize -PRON- because -PRON- want -PRON- and sir
clifford because -PRON- be lord of the seignorie of those part sir
clifford 's whale have be articulate throughout so that like a
great chest of drawer -PRON- can open and shut -PRON- in all -PRON- bony
cavity spread out -PRON- rib like a gigantic fan and swing all day
upon -PRON- low jaw lock be to be put upon some of -PRON- trap door and
shutter and a footman will show round future visitor with a bunch of
key at -PRON- side sir clifford think of charge twopence for a peep at
the whispering gallery in the spinal column threepence to hear the echo
in the hollow of -PRON- cerebellum and sixpence for the unrivalled view
from -PRON- forehead

the skeleton dimension -PRON- shall now proceed to set down be copy
verbatim from -PRON- right arm where -PRON- have -PRON- tattooed as in -PRON- wild
wandering at that period there be no other secure way of preserve
such valuable statistic but as -PRON- be crowd for space and wish
the other part of -PRON- body to remain a blank page for a poem -PRON- be
then compose at least what untattooed part may remain -PRON- do not
trouble -PRON- with the odd inch nor indeed should inch at all
enter into a congenial admeasurement of the whale



chapter 103 measurement of the whale 's skeleton


in the first place -PRON- wish to lay before -PRON- a particular plain
statement touch the live bulk of this leviathan whose skeleton -PRON-
be briefly to exhibit such a statement may prove useful here

accord to a careful calculation -PRON- have make and which -PRON- partly base
upon captain scoresby 's estimate of seventy ton for the large
sized greenland whale of sixty foot in length accord to -PRON- careful
calculation -PRON- say a sperm whale of the large magnitude between
eighty five and ninety foot in length and something less than forty
foot in -PRON- full circumference such a whale will weigh at least
ninety ton so that reckon thirteen man to a ton -PRON- would
considerably outweigh the combined population of a whole village of one
thousand one hundred inhabitant

think -PRON- not then that brain like yoked cattle should be put to this
leviathan to make -PRON- at all budge to any landsman 's imagination

have already in various way put before -PRON- -PRON- skull spout hole
jaw tooth tail forehead fin and diver other part -PRON- shall now
simply point out what be most interesting in the general bulk of -PRON-
unobstructed bone but as the colossal skull embrace so very large
a proportion of the entire extent of the skeleton as -PRON- be by far the
most complicated part and as nothing be to be repeat concern -PRON- in
this chapter -PRON- must not fail to carry -PRON- in -PRON- mind or under -PRON-
arm as -PRON- proce otherwise -PRON- will not gain a complete notion of the
general structure -PRON- be about to view

in length the sperm whale 's skeleton at tranque measure seventy two
foot so that when fully invest and extend in life -PRON- must have
be ninety foot long for in the whale the skeleton lose about one
fifth in length compare with the live body of this seventy two foot
-PRON- skull and jaw comprise some twenty foot leave some fifty foot of
plain back bone attach to this back bone for something less than a
third of -PRON- length be the mighty circular basket of rib which once
enclose -PRON- vital

to -PRON- this vast ivory rib chest with the long unrelieved spine
extend far away from -PRON- in a straight line not a little resemble
the hull of a great ship new lay upon the stock when only some twenty
of -PRON- naked bow rib be insert and the keel be otherwise for the
time but a long disconnected timber

the rib be ten on a side the first to begin from the neck
be nearly six foot long the second third and fourth be each
successively longer till -PRON- come to the climax of the fifth or one
of the middle rib which measure eight foot and some inch from
that part the remain rib diminish till the tenth and last only
span five foot and some inch in general thickness -PRON- all bear
a seemly correspondence to -PRON- length the middle rib be the most
arch in some of the arsacides -PRON- be use for beam whereon to lay
footpath bridge over small stream

in consider these rib -PRON- could not but be strike anew with the
circumstance so variously repeat in this book that the skeleton of
the whale be by no mean the mould of -PRON- invest form the large of
the tranque rib one of the middle one occupy that part of the fish
which in life be great in depth now the great depth of the
invest body of this particular whale must have be at least sixteen
foot whereas the correspond rib measure but little more than eight
foot so that this rib only convey half of the true notion of the
live magnitude of that part besides for some way where -PRON- now see
but a naked spine all that have be once wrap round with ton of
add bulk in flesh muscle blood and bowel still more for the
ample fin -PRON- here see but a few disordered joint and in place of the
weighty and majestic but boneless fluke an utter blank

how vain and foolish then think -PRON- for timid untravelled man to try
to comprehend aright this wondrous whale by merely pore over -PRON- dead
attenuated skeleton stretch in this peaceful wood no only in the
heart of quick peril only when within the eddying of -PRON- angry
fluke only on the profound unbounded sea can the fully invest whale
be truly and livingly find out

but the spine for that the good way -PRON- can consider -PRON- be with a
crane to pile -PRON- bone high up on end no speedy enterprise but now
-PRON- be do -PRON- look much like pompey 's pillar

there be forty and odd vertebra in all which in the skeleton be
not lock together -PRON- mostly lie like the great knobbed block on
a gothic spire form solid course of heavy masonry the large
a middle one be in width something less than three foot and in depth
more than four the small where the spine taper away into the
tail be only two inch in width and look something like a white
billiard ball -PRON- be tell that there be still small one but -PRON-
have be lose by some little cannibal urchin the priest 's child
who have steal -PRON- to play marble with thus -PRON- see how that the
spine of even the huge of live thing taper off at last into simple
child 's play



chapter 104 the fossil whale


from -PRON- mighty bulk the whale afford a most congenial theme whereon
to enlarge amplify and generally expatiate would -PRON- -PRON- could not
compress -PRON- by good right -PRON- should only be treat of in imperial
folio not to tell over again -PRON- furlong from spiracle to tail
and the yard -PRON- measure about the waist only think of the gigantic
involution of -PRON- intestine where -PRON- lie in -PRON- like great
cable and hawser coil away in the subterranean orlop deck of a
line of battle ship

since -PRON- have undertake to manhandle this leviathan -PRON- behoove -PRON-
to approve -PRON- omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise not
overlook the minute seminal germ of -PRON- blood and spin -PRON-
out to the uttermost coil of -PRON- bowel have already describe -PRON-
in most of -PRON- present habitatory and anatomical peculiarity -PRON-
now remain to magnify -PRON- in an archaeological fossiliferous and
antediluvian point of view applied to any other creature than the
leviathan to an ant or a flea such portly term may justly be deem
unwarrantably grandiloquent but when leviathan be the text the case be
alter fain be -PRON- to stagger to this emprise under the weightiest
word of the dictionary and here be -PRON- say that whenever -PRON- have be
convenient to consult one in the course of these dissertation -PRON- have
invariably use a huge quarto edition of johnson expressly purchase
for that purpose because that famous lexicographer 's uncommon personal
bulk more fit -PRON- to compile a lexicon to be use by a whale author
like -PRON-

one often hear of writer that rise and swell with -PRON- subject
though -PRON- may seem but an ordinary one how then with -PRON- write
of this leviathan unconsciously -PRON- chirography expand into placard
capital give -PRON- a condor 's quill give -PRON- vesuvius crater for an
inkstand friend hold -PRON- arm for in the mere act of pen -PRON-
thought of this leviathan -PRON- weary -PRON- and make -PRON- faint with -PRON-
outreach comprehensiveness of sweep as if to include the whole
circle of the science and all the generation of whale and man and
mastodon past present and to come with all the revolving panorama
of empire on earth and throughout the whole universe not exclude -PRON-
suburbs such and so magnifying be the virtue of a large and liberal
theme -PRON- expand to -PRON- bulk to produce a mighty book -PRON- must choose
a mighty theme no great and enduring volume can ever be write on the
flea though many there be who have try -PRON-

ere enter upon the subject of fossil whales -PRON- present -PRON- credential
as a geologist by state that in -PRON- miscellaneous time -PRON- have be
a stone mason and also a great digger of ditch canal and well
wine vault cellar and cistern of all sort likewise by way of
preliminary -PRON- desire to remind the reader that while in the early
geological stratum there be find the fossil of monster now almost
completely extinct the subsequent relic discover in what be call
the tertiary formation seem the connect or at any rate intercept
link between the antichronical creature and those whose remote
posterity be say to have enter the ark all the fossil whales
hitherto discover belong to the tertiary period which be the last
precede the superficial formation and though none of -PRON-
precisely answer to any know specie of the present time -PRON- be yet
sufficiently akin to -PRON- in general respect to justify -PRON- take
rank as cetacean fossil

detach break fossil of pre adamite whale fragment of -PRON- bone
and skeleton have within thirty year past at various interval be
find at the base of the alps in lombardy in france in england in
scotland and in the states of louisiana mississippi and alabama
among the more curious of such remain be part of a skull which in the
year 1779 be disinter in the rue dauphine in paris a short street
open almost directly upon the palace of the tuileries and bone
disinter in excavate the great dock of antwerp in napoleon 's
time cuvier pronounce these fragment to have belong to some utterly
unknown leviathanic specie

but by far the most wonderful of all cetacean relic be the almost
complete vast skeleton of an extinct monster find in the year 1842 on
the plantation of judge creagh in alabama the awe stricken credulous
slave in the vicinity take -PRON- for the bone of one of the fall
angel the alabama doctor declare -PRON- a huge reptile and bestow
upon -PRON- the name of basilosaurus but some specimen bone of -PRON- be
take across the sea to owen the english anatomist -PRON- turn out
that this alleged reptile be a whale though of a depart specie a
significant illustration of the fact again and again repeat in this
book that the skeleton of the whale furnish but little clue to the
shape of -PRON- fully invest body so owen rechristen the monster
zeuglodon and in -PRON- paper read before the london geological society
pronounce -PRON- in substance one of the most extraordinary creature
which the mutation of the globe have blot out of existence

when -PRON- stand among these mighty leviathan skeleton skull tusk
jaw rib and vertebra all characterize by partial resemblance to
the exist breed of sea monster but at the same time bear on
the other hand similar affinity to the annihilate antichronical
leviathans -PRON- incalculable senior -PRON- be by a flood bear back
to that wondrous period ere time -PRON- can be say to have begin
for time begin with man here saturn 's grey chaos roll over -PRON- and -PRON-
obtain dim shudder glimpse into those polar eternity when wedge
bastion of ice press hard upon what be now the tropics and in
all the 25,000 mile of this world 's circumference not an inhabitable
hand 's breadth of land be visible then the whole world be the
whale 's and king of creation -PRON- leave -PRON- wake along the present line
of the andes and the himmalehs who can show a pedigree like leviathan
ahab 's harpoon have shed old blood than the pharaoh 's methuselah seem
a school boy -PRON- look round to shake hand with shem -PRON- be horror strike
at this antemosaic unsourced existence of the unspeakable terror of
the whale which have be before all time must need exist after
all humane age be over

but not alone have this leviathan leave -PRON- pre adamite trace in the
stereotype plate of nature and in limestone and marl bequeath -PRON-
ancient bust but upon egyptian tablet whose antiquity seem to claim
for -PRON- an almost fossiliferous character -PRON- find the unmistakable
print of -PRON- fin in an apartment of the great temple of denderah
some fifty year ago there be discover upon the granite ceiling a
sculptured and paint planisphere abound in centaur griffin and
dolphin similar to the grotesque figure on the celestial globe of the
modern glide among -PRON- old leviathan swim as of yore be there
swimming in that planisphere century before solomon be cradle

nor must there be omit another strange attestation of the antiquity
of the whale in -PRON- own osseous post diluvian reality as set down by
the venerable john leo the old barbary traveller

not far from the sea side -PRON- have a temple the rafters and beams
of which be make of whale bones for whales of a monstrous size be
oftentime cast up dead upon that shore the common people imagine that
by a secret power bestow by god upon the temple no whale can pass -PRON-
without immediate death but the truth of the matter be that on either
side of the temple there be rock that shoot two miles into the sea
and wind the whales when -PRON- light upon 'em -PRON- keep a whale 's rib
of an incredible length for a miracle which lie upon the ground with
-PRON- convex part uppermost make an arch the head of which can not be
reach by a man upon a camel 's back this rib say john leo be say
to have layn there a hundred years before -PRON- see -PRON- -PRON- historian
affirm that a prophet who prophesy'd of mahomet come from this temple
and some do not stand to assert that the prophet jonas be cast forth
by the whale at the base of the temple

in this afric temple of the whale -PRON- leave -PRON- reader and if -PRON- be a
nantucketer and a whaleman -PRON- will silently worship there



chapter 105 do the whale 's magnitude diminish will -PRON- perish


inasmuch then as this leviathan come flounder down upon -PRON- from
the head water of the eternities -PRON- may be fitly inquire whether
in the long course of -PRON- generation -PRON- have not degenerate from the
original bulk of -PRON- sire

but upon investigation -PRON- find that not only be the whale of the
present day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil remain be
find in the tertiary system embrace a distinct geological period
prior to man but of the whale find in that tertiary system those
belong to -PRON- latter formation exce in size those of -PRON- early
one

of all the pre adamite whale yet exhume by far the large be the
alabama one mention in the last chapter and that be less than
seventy foot in length in the skeleton whereas -PRON- have already see
that the tape measure give seventy two foot for the skeleton of a large
size modern whale and -PRON- have hear on whaleman 's authority that
sperm whales have be capture near a hundred foot long at the time of
capture

but may -PRON- not be that while the whale of the present hour be an
advance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological period may
-PRON- not be that since adam 's time -PRON- have degenerate

assuredly -PRON- must conclude so if -PRON- be to credit the account of such
gentleman as pliny and the ancient naturalist generally for pliny
tell -PRON- of whales that embrace acre of living bulk and aldrovandus
of other which measure eight hundred foot in length rope walks and
thames tunnels of whales and even in the day of bank and solander
cooke 's naturalist -PRON- find a danish member of the academy of sciences
set down certain iceland whales reydan siskur or wrinkled belly
at one hundred and twenty yard that is three hundred and sixty foot
and lacepede the french naturalist in -PRON- elaborate history of whale
in the very beginning of -PRON- work page 3 set down the right whale at
one hundred metre three hundred and twenty eight foot and this work
be publish so late as a.d. 1825

but will any whaleman believe these story no the whale of to day be
as big as -PRON- ancestor in pliny 's time and if ever -PRON- go where pliny
be -PRON- a whaleman more than -PRON- be will make bold to tell -PRON- so
because -PRON- can not understand how -PRON- be that while the egyptian mummy
that be bury thousand of year before even pliny be bear do not
measure so much in -PRON- coffin as a modern kentuckian in -PRON- sock
and while the cattle and other animal sculpture on the old egyptian
and nineveh tablet by the relative proportion in which -PRON- be
draw just as plainly prove that the high breed stall feed prize cattle
of smithfield not only equal but far exce in magnitude the fat
of pharaoh 's fat kine in the face of all this -PRON- will not admit that of
all animal the whale alone should have degenerate

but still another inquiry remain one often agitate by the more
recondite nantucketers whether owe to the almost omniscient look out
at the mast head of the whaleship now penetrate even through
behring 's strait and into the remotest secret drawer and locker
of the world and the thousand harpoon and lance dart along all
continental coast the moot point be whether leviathan can long endure
so wide a chase and so remorseless a havoc whether -PRON- must not at last
be exterminate from the water and the last whale like the last man
smoke -PRON- last pipe and then -PRON- evaporate in the final puff

compare the humped herd of whale with the humped herd of buffalo
which not forty year ago overspread by ten of thousand the prairie
of illinois and missouri and shake -PRON- iron mane and scowl with
-PRON- thunder clot brow upon the site of populous river capital
where now the polite broker sell -PRON- land at a dollar an inch in such
a comparison an irresistible argument would seem furnished to show that
the hunted whale can not now escape speedy extinction

but -PRON- must look at this matter in every light though so short a
period ago not a good lifetime the census of the buffalo in illinois
exceed the census of man now in london and though at the present day
not one horn or hoof of -PRON- remain in all that region and though the
cause of this wondrous extermination be the spear of man yet the far
different nature of the whale hunt peremptorily forbid so inglorious an
end to the leviathan forty man in one ship hunt the sperm whales for
forty eight month think -PRON- have do extremely well and thank god
if at last -PRON- carry home the oil of forty fish whereas in the day
of the old canadian and indian hunter and trapper of the west when
the far west in whose sunset sun still rise be a wilderness and
a virgin the same number of moccasin man for the same number of
month mount on horse instead of sail in ship would have slay
not forty but forty thousand and more buffalo a fact that if ne
be could be statistically state

nor consider aright do -PRON- seem any argument in favour of the
gradual extinction of the sperm whale for example that in former year
the latter part of the last century say these leviathans in
small pod be encounter much oftener than at present and in
consequence the voyage be not so prolonged and be also much more
remunerative because as have be elsewhere notice those whale
influence by some view to safety now swim the sea in immense
caravan so that to a large degree the scatter solitary yoke and
pod and school of other day be now aggregate into vast but widely
separate unfrequent army that be all and equally fallacious seem
the conceit that because the so call whale bone whale no longer
haunt many ground in former year abound with -PRON- hence that
specie also be decline for -PRON- be only be drive from
promontory to cape and if one coast be no longer enliven with
-PRON- jet then be sure some other and remoter strand have be very
recently startle by the unfamiliar spectacle

furthermore concern these last mention leviathans -PRON- have two
firm fortress which in all human probability will for ever remain
impregnable and as upon the invasion of -PRON- valley the frosty swiss
have retreat to -PRON- mountain so hunt from the savanna and
glade of the middle sea the whale bone whale can at last resort to
-PRON- polar citadel and diving under the ultimate glassy barrier and
wall there come up among icy field and floe and in a charmed circle
of everlasting december bid defiance to all pursuit from man

but as perhaps fifty of these whale bone whale be harpoon for one
cachalot some philosopher of the forecastle have conclude that this
positive havoc have already very seriously diminish -PRON- battalion
but though for some time past a number of these whale not less than
13,000 have be annually slay on the nor'-west coast by the americans
alone yet there be consideration which render even this circumstance
of little or no account as an oppose argument in this matter

natural as -PRON- be to be somewhat incredulous concern the populousness
of the more enormous creature of the globe yet what shall -PRON- say to
harto the historian of goa when -PRON- tell -PRON- that at one hunt the
king of siam take 4,000 elephant that in those region elephant be
numerous as drove of cattle in the temperate clime and there seem no
reason to doubt that if these elephant which have now be hunt for
thousand of year by semiramis by porus by hannibal and by all the
successive monarchs of the east if -PRON- still survive there in great
number much more may the great whale outlast all hunting since -PRON-
have a pasture to expatiate in which be precisely twice as large as all
asia both americas europe and africa new holland and all the isles
of the sea combine

moreover -PRON- be to consider that from the presume great longevity
of whale -PRON- probably attain the age of a century and more
therefore at any one period of time several distinct adult generation
must be contemporary and what that be -PRON- may soon gain some idea
of by imagine all the grave yard cemetery and family vault of
creation yield up the live body of all the man woman and child
who be alive seventy five year ago and add this countless host to
the present human population of the globe

wherefore for all these thing -PRON- account the whale immortal in -PRON-
specie however perishable in -PRON- individuality -PRON- swim the sea
before the continent break water -PRON- once swim over the site of the
tuilerie and windsor castle and the kremlin in noah 's flood -PRON-
despise noah 's ark and if ever the world be to be again flood like
the netherlands to kill off -PRON- rat then the eternal whale will still
survive and rear upon the topmost crest of the equatorial flood
spout -PRON- froth defiance to the sky



chapter 106 ahab 's leg


the precipitate manner in which captain ahab have quit the samuel
enderby of london have not be unattended with some small violence to
-PRON- own person -PRON- have light with such energy upon a thwart of -PRON-
boat that -PRON- ivory leg have receive a half splinter shock and
when after gain -PRON- own deck and -PRON- own pivot hole there -PRON- so
vehemently wheel round with an urgent command to the steersman -PRON-
be as ever something about -PRON- not steer inflexibly enough then
the already shake ivory receive such an additional twist and wrench
that though -PRON- still remain entire and to all appearance lusty yet
ahab do not deem -PRON- entirely trustworthy

and indeed -PRON- seem small matter for wonder that for all -PRON-
pervade mad recklessness ahab do at time give careful heed to the
condition of that dead bone upon which -PRON- partly stand for -PRON- have not
be very long prior to the pequod 's sailing from nantucket that -PRON-
have be find one night lie prone upon the ground and insensible
by some unknown and seemingly inexplicable unimaginable casualty -PRON-
ivory limb have be so violently displace that -PRON- have stake wise
smitten and all but pierce -PRON- groin nor be -PRON- without extreme
difficulty that the agonizing wound be entirely cure

nor at the time have -PRON- fail to enter -PRON- monomaniac mind that all
the anguish of that then present suffering be but the direct issue of a
former woe and -PRON- too plainly seem to see that as the most poisonous
reptile of the marsh perpetuate -PRON- kind as inevitably as the sweet
songster of the grove so equally with every felicity all miserable
event do naturally beget -PRON- like yea more than equally think
ahab since both the ancestry and posterity of grief go further than the
ancestry and posterity of joy for not to hint of this that -PRON- be
an inference from certain canonic teaching that while some natural
enjoyment here shall have no child bear to -PRON- for the other world
but on the contrary shall be follow by the joy childlessness of
all hell 's despair whereas some guilty mortal misery shall still
fertilely beget to -PRON- an eternally progressive progeny of grief
beyond the grave not at all to hint of this there still seem an
inequality in the deep analysis of the thing for think ahab while
even the high earthly felicity ever have a certain unsignifying
pettiness lurk in -PRON- but at bottom all heartwoe a mystic
significance and in some man an archangelic grandeur so do -PRON-
diligent tracing out not belie the obvious deduction to trail the
genealogy of these high mortal misery carry -PRON- at last among the
sourceless primogeniture of the god so that in the face of all the
glad hay make sun and soft cymballing round harvest moon -PRON- must
need give in to this that the god -PRON- be not for ever glad
the ineffaceable sad birth mark in the brow of man be but the stamp of
sorrow in the signer

unwittingly here a secret have be divulge which perhaps may more
properly in set way have be disclose before with many other
particular concern ahab always have -PRON- remain a mystery to some
why -PRON- be that for a certain period both before and after the sailing
of the pequod -PRON- have hide -PRON- away with such grand lama like
exclusiveness and for that one interval seek speechless refuge as
-PRON- be among the marble senate of the dead captain peleg 's bruited
reason for this thing appear by no mean adequate though indeed
as touch all ahab 's deep part every revelation partook more of
significant darkness than of explanatory light but in the end -PRON- all
come out this one matter do at least that direful mishap be at
the bottom of -PRON- temporary recluseness and not only this but to that
ever contracting drop circle ashore who for any reason possess
the privilege of a less ban approach to -PRON- to that timid circle the
above hint casualty remain as -PRON- do moodily unaccounted for by
ahab invest -PRON- with terror not entirely underiv from the land
of spirit and of wail so that through -PRON- zeal for -PRON- -PRON- have
all conspire so far as in -PRON- lie to muffle up the knowledge of
this thing from other and hence -PRON- be that not till a considerable
interval have elapse do -PRON- transpire upon the pequod 's deck

but be all this as -PRON- may let the unseen ambiguous synod in the air
or the vindictive prince and potentate of fire have to do or not
with earthly ahab yet in this present matter of -PRON- leg -PRON- take plain
practical procedure -PRON- call the carpenter

and when that functionary appear before -PRON- -PRON- bid -PRON- without delay
set about make a new leg and direct the mate to see -PRON- supply
with all the stud and joist of jaw ivory sperm whale which have thus
far be accumulate on the voyage in order that a careful selection
of the stout clearest grain stuff may be secure this do the
carpenter receive order to have the leg complete that night and to
provide all the fitting for -PRON- independent of those pertain to
the distrust one in use moreover the ship 's forge be order to be
hoist out of -PRON- temporary idleness in the hold and to accelerate
the affair the blacksmith be command to proceed at once to the
forging of whatev iron contrivance may be need



chapter 107 the carpenter


seat thyself sultanically among the moon of saturn and take high
abstracted man alone and -PRON- seem a wonder a grandeur and a woe but
from the same point take mankind in mass and for the most part -PRON-
seem a mob of unnecessary duplicate both contemporary and hereditary
but most humble though -PRON- be and far from furnish an example of
the high humane abstraction the pequod 's carpenter be no duplicate
hence -PRON- now come in person on this stage

like all sea go ship carpenter and more especially those belong
to whaling vessel -PRON- be to a certain off handed practical extent
alike experience in numerous trade and calling collateral to -PRON- own
the carpenter 's pursuit be the ancient and outbranching trunk of all
those numerous handicraft which more or less have to do with wood as an
auxiliary material but besides the application to -PRON- of the generic
remark above this carpenter of the pequod be singularly efficient in
those thousand nameless mechanical emergency continually recur
in a large ship upon a three or four year voyage in uncivilized
and far distant sea for not to speak of -PRON- readiness in ordinary
duty repair stove boat sprung spar reform the shape of
clumsy bladed oar insert bull 's eye in the deck or new tree nail
in the side plank and other miscellaneous matter more directly
pertain to -PRON- special business -PRON- be moreover unhesitatingly
expert in all manner of conflict aptitude both useful and
capricious

the one grand stage where -PRON- enact all -PRON- various part so manifold
be -PRON- vice bench a long rude ponderous table furnish with several
vice of different size and both of iron and of wood at all time
except when whale be alongside this bench be securely lash
athwartship against the rear of the try work

a belaying pin be find too large to be easily insert into -PRON- hole
the carpenter clap -PRON- into one of -PRON- ever ready vice and straightway
file -PRON- small a lost land bird of strange plumage stray on board
and be make a captive out of clean shave rod of right whale bone and
cross beam of sperm whale ivory the carpenter make a pagoda look
cage for -PRON- an oarsman sprain -PRON- wrist the carpenter concoct a
soothe lotion stubb long for vermillion star to be paint upon
the blade of -PRON- every oar screw each oar in -PRON- big vice of wood
the carpenter symmetrically supply the constellation a sailor take
a fancy to wear shark bone ear ring the carpenter drill -PRON- ear
another have the toothache the carpenter out pincer and clap
one hand upon -PRON- bench bid -PRON- be seat there but the poor fellow
unmanageably wince under the unconcluded operation whirl round the
handle of -PRON- wooden vice the carpenter signs -PRON- to clap -PRON- jaw in
that if -PRON- would have -PRON- draw the tooth

thus this carpenter be prepare at all point and alike indifferent
and without respect in all teeth -PRON- account bit of ivory head -PRON-
deem but top block man -PRON- -PRON- lightly hold for capstan but
while now upon so wide a field thus variously accomplish and with such
liveliness of expertness in -PRON- too all this would seem to argue some
uncommon vivacity of intelligence but not precisely so for nothing be
this man more remarkable than for a certain impersonal stolidity as
-PRON- be impersonal -PRON- say for -PRON- so shade off into the surround
infinite of thing that -PRON- seem one with the general stolidity
discernible in the whole visible world which while pauselessly active
in uncounted mode still eternally hold -PRON- peace and ignore -PRON-
though -PRON- dig foundation for cathedral yet be this half horrible
stolidity in -PRON- involve too as -PRON- appear an all ramify
heartlessness yet be -PRON- oddly dash at time with an old
crutch like antediluvian wheeze humorousness not unstreak now
and then with a certain grizzled wittiness such as may have serve
to pass the time during the midnight watch on the bearded forecastle
of noah 's ark be -PRON- that this old carpenter have be a life long
wanderer whose much rolling to and fro not only have gather no moss
but what be more have rub off whatev small outward clinging
may have originally pertain to -PRON- -PRON- be a stript abstract an
unfractioned integral uncompromised as a new bear babe live without
premeditate reference to this world or the next -PRON- may almost
say that this strange uncompromisedness in -PRON- involve a sort of
unintelligence for in -PRON- numerous trade -PRON- do not seem to work so
much by reason or by instinct or simply because -PRON- have be tutor to
-PRON- or by any intermixture of all these even or uneven but merely by
a kind of deaf and dumb spontaneous literal process -PRON- be a pure
manipulator -PRON- brain if -PRON- have ever have one must have early
ooze along into the muscle of -PRON- finger -PRON- be like one of
those unreason but still highly useful multum in parvo sheffield
contrivance assume the exterior though a little swelled of a
common pocket knife but contain not only blade of various size
but also screw driver cork screw tweezer awl pen ruler
nail filer countersinker so if -PRON- superior want to use the
carpenter for a screw driver all -PRON- have to do be to open that part
of -PRON- and the screw be fast or if for tweezer take -PRON- up by the
leg and there -PRON- be

yet as previously hint this omnitool open and shut carpenter
be after all no mere machine of an automaton if -PRON- do not have a
common soul in -PRON- -PRON- have a subtle something that somehow anomalously
do -PRON- duty what that be whether essence of quicksilver or a few
drop of hartshorn there be no telling but there -PRON- be and there -PRON-
have abide for now some sixty year or more and this -PRON- be this same
unaccountable cunn life principle in -PRON- this -PRON- be that keep
-PRON- a great part of the time soliloquizing but only like an unreasoning
wheel which also hummingly soliloquize or rather -PRON- body be a
sentry box and this soliloquizer on guard there and talk all the
time to keep -PRON- awake



chapter 108 ahab and the carpenter

the deck first night watch


carpenter standing before his vice bench and by the light of two
lantern busily filing the ivory joist for the leg which joist be
firmly fixed in the vice slab of ivory leather straps pads screws
and various tool of all sorts lying about the bench forward the red
flame of the forge be seen where the blacksmith be at work


drat the file and drat the bone that be hard which should be soft
and that be soft which should be hard so -PRON- go who file old jaw and
shinbone let 's try another aye now this work better sneezes
halloa this bone dust be sneezes)--why -PRON- be sneezes)--yes -PRON- be
sneezes)--bless -PRON- soul -PRON- will not let -PRON- speak this be what an old
fellow get now for work in dead lumber see a live tree and
-PRON- do not get this dust amputate a live bone and -PRON- do not get -PRON-
sneezes come come -PRON- old smut there bear a hand and let 's have
that ferule and buckle screw -PRON- will be ready for -PRON- presently lucky
now sneezes there be no knee joint to make that may puzzle a little
but a mere shinbone why -PRON- be easy as make hop pole only -PRON- should
like to put a good finish on time time if -PRON- but only have the time -PRON-
could turn -PRON- out as neat a leg now as ever sneezes scrap to a lady
in a parlor those buckskin leg and calf of leg -PRON- have see in shop
window would not compare at all -PRON- soak water -PRON- do and of
course get rheumatic and have to be doctor sneezes with wash and
lotion just like live leg there before -PRON- see -PRON- off now -PRON- must
call -PRON- old mogulship and see whether the length will be all right
too short if anything -PRON- gues ha that be the heel -PRON- be in luck
here -PRON- come or -PRON- be somebody else that be certain

ahab advancing

during the ensuing scene the carpenter continue sneeze at times


well manmaker

just in time sir if the captain please -PRON- will now mark the length
let -PRON- measure sir

measure for a leg good well -PRON- be not the first time about -PRON-
there keep thy finger on -PRON- this be a cogent vice thou hast here
carpenter let -PRON- feel -PRON- grip once so so -PRON- do pinch some

oh sir -PRON- will break bone beware beware

no fear -PRON- like a good grip -PRON- like to feel something in this
slippery world that can hold man what be prometheus about there the
blacksmith -PRON- mean what be -PRON- about

-PRON- must be forge the buckle screw sir now

right -PRON- be a partnership -PRON- supply the muscle part -PRON- make a
fierce red flame there

aye sir -PRON- must have the white heat for this kind of fine work

um m so -PRON- must -PRON- do deem -PRON- now a most meaning thing that that
old greek prometheus who make man -PRON- say should have be a
blacksmith and animate -PRON- with fire for what be make in fire must
properly belong to fire and so hell 's probable how the soot fly
this must be the remainder the greek make the africans of carpenter
when -PRON- be through with that buckle tell -PRON- to forge a pair of steel
shoulder blade there be a pedlar aboard with a crushing pack

sir

hold while prometheus be about -PRON- -PRON- will order a complete man after a
desirable pattern imprimis fifty foot high in -PRON- sock then chest
model after the thames tunnel then leg with root to 'em to stay
in one place then arm three foot through the wrist no heart at all
brass forehead and about a quarter of an acre of fine brain and let
-PRON- see shall -PRON- order eye to see outward no but put a sky light on
top of -PRON- head to illuminate inward there take the order and away

now what be -PRON- speak about and who be -PRON- speak to -PRON- should like
to know shall -PRON- keep stand here aside

tis but indifferent architecture to make a blind dome here be one no
no no -PRON- must have a lantern

ho ho that be -PRON- hey here be two sir one will serve -PRON- turn

what art thou thrust that thief catcher into -PRON- face for man
thrust light be bad than present pistol

-PRON- think sir that -PRON- speak to carpenter


carpenter why that's but no a very tidy and -PRON- may say
an extremely gentlemanlike sort of business thou art in here
carpenter or would'st thou rather work in clay

sir clay clay sir that be mud -PRON- leave clay to ditcher sir

the fellow 's impious what art thou sneeze about

bone be rather dusty sir

take the hint then and when thou art dead never bury thyself under
live people 's nose

sir oh ah!--i guess so yes dear

look ye carpenter -PRON- dare say thou callest thyself a right good
workmanlike workman eh well then will -PRON- speak thoroughly well
for thy work if when -PRON- come to mount this leg thou mak -PRON- shall
nevertheless feel another leg in the same identical place with -PRON- that
be carpenter -PRON- old lost leg the flesh and blood one -PRON- mean canst
thou not drive that old adam away

truly sir -PRON- begin to understand somewhat now yes -PRON- have hear
something curious on that score sir how that a dismasted man never
entirely lose the feeling of -PRON- old spar but -PRON- will be still
prick -PRON- at time may -PRON- humbly ask if -PRON- be really so sir

-PRON- be man look put thy live leg here in the place where mine once
be so now here be only one distinct leg to the eye yet two to the
soul where thou feelest tingle life there exactly there there to a
hair do i. is't a riddle

-PRON- should humbly call -PRON- a poser sir

hist then how dost thou know that some entire live think thing
may not be invisibly and uninterpenetratingly stand precisely where
thou now stand aye and stand there in thy spite in thy most
solitary hour then dost thou not fear eavesdropper hold do not
speak and if -PRON- still feel the smart of -PRON- crush leg though -PRON- be now
so long dissolve then why mayst not thou carpenter feel the fiery
pain of hell for ever and without a body hah

good lord truly sir if -PRON- come to that -PRON- must calculate over again
-PRON- think -PRON- do not carry a small figure sir

look ye pudding head should never grant premise how long before the
leg be do

perhaps an hour sir

bungle away at -PRON- then and bring -PRON- to -PRON- turns to go oh life here
-PRON- be proud as greek god and yet stand debtor to this blockhead for
a bone to stand on curse be that mortal inter indebtedness which will
not do away with ledger -PRON- would be free as air and -PRON- be down in the
whole world 's book -PRON- be so rich -PRON- could have give bid for bid with
the wealthy praetorians at the auction of the roman empire which be
the world 's and yet -PRON- owe for the flesh in the tongue -PRON- brag with by
heaven -PRON- will get a crucible and into -PRON- and dissolve -PRON- down to
one small compendious vertebra so

carpenter resume his work


well well well stubb know -PRON- good of all and stubb always say
-PRON- be queer say nothing but that one sufficient little word queer -PRON- be
queer say stubb -PRON- 's queer queer queer and keep din -PRON- into
mr. starbuck all the time queer sir queer queer very queer and
here be -PRON- leg yes now that -PRON- think of -PRON- here be -PRON- bedfellow have
a stick of whale 's jaw bone for a wife and this be -PRON- leg -PRON- will stand
on this what be that now about one leg stand in three place and
all three place stand in one hell how be that oh -PRON- do not wonder
-PRON- look so scornful at -PRON- -PRON- be a sort of strange thought sometimes
-PRON- say but that be only haphazard like then a short little old body
like -PRON- should never undertake to wade out into deep water with tall
heron build captain the water chuck -PRON- under the chin pretty quick
and there be a great cry for life boat and here be the heron 's leg
long and slim sure enough now for most folk one pair of leg last
a lifetime and that must be because -PRON- use -PRON- mercifully as a
tender hearted old lady use -PRON- roly poly old coach horse but ahab
oh -PRON- be a hard driver look drive one leg to death and spavin the
other for life and now wear out bone leg by the cord halloa there
-PRON- smut bear a hand there with those screw and let 's finish -PRON-
before the resurrection fellow come a calling with -PRON- horn for
all leg true or false as brewery man go round collect old beer
barrel to fill 'em up again what a leg this be -PRON- look like a real
live leg file down to nothing but the core -PRON- will be stand on this
to morrow -PRON- will be take altitude on -PRON- halloa -PRON- almost forget the
little oval slate smooth ivory where -PRON- figure up the latitude so
so chisel file and sand paper now



chapter 109 ahab and starbuck in the cabin


accord to usage -PRON- be pump the ship next morning and lo no
inconsiderable oil come up with the water the cask below must have
spring a bad leak much concern be show and starbuck go down into
the cabin to report this unfavourable affair


in sperm whaleman with any considerable quantity of oil on board -PRON-
be a regular semiweekly duty to conduct a hose into the hold and drench
the cask with sea water which afterwards at vary interval be
remove by the ship 's pump hereby the cask be seek to be keep
damply tight while by the change character of the withdrawn water the
mariner readily detect any serious leakage in the precious cargo


now from the south and west the pequod be draw nigh to formosa and
the bashee isles between which lie one of the tropical outlet from
the china water into the pacific and so starbuck find ahab with
a general chart of the oriental archipelago spread before -PRON-
and another separate one represent the long eastern coast of the
japanese island niphon matsmai and sikoke with -PRON- snow white new
ivory leg brace against the screw leg of -PRON- table and with a long
prune hook of a jack knife in -PRON- hand the wondrous old man with -PRON-
back to the gangway door be wrinkle -PRON- brow and trace -PRON- old
course again

who be there hear the footstep at the door but not turn round
to -PRON- on deck begone

captain ahab mistake -PRON- be i. the oil in the hold be leak sir -PRON-
must up burtons and break out

up burton and break out now that -PRON- be near japan heave to here
for a week to tinker a parcel of old hoop

either do that sir or waste in one day more oil than -PRON- may make good
in a year what -PRON- come twenty thousand mile to get be worth save
sir

so -PRON- be so -PRON- be if -PRON- get -PRON-

-PRON- be speak of the oil in the hold sir

and -PRON- be not speak or think of that at all begone let -PRON- leak
-PRON- be all aleak -PRON- aye leak in leak not only full of leaky cask
but those leaky cask be in a leaky ship and that be a far bad plight
than the pequod 's man yet -PRON- do not stop to plug -PRON- leak for who can
find -PRON- in the deep loaded hull or how hope to plug -PRON- even if
find in this life 's howl gale starbuck -PRON- will not have the burtons
hoist

what will the owner say sir

let the owner stand on nantucket beach and outyell the typhoons what
care ahab owner owner thou art always prate to -PRON- starbuck
about those miserly owner as if the owner be -PRON- conscience but
look ye the only real owner of anything be -PRON- commander and hark ye
-PRON- conscience be in this ship 's keel on deck

captain ahab say the reddening mate move further into the cabin
with a daring so strangely respectful and cautious that -PRON- almost seem
not only every way seek to avoid the slight outward manifestation
of -PRON- but within also seem more than half distrustful of -PRON-
a good man than -PRON- may well pass over in thee what -PRON- would quickly
enough resent in a young man aye and in a happy captain ahab

devil dost thou then so much as dare to critically think of -PRON- on
deck

nay sir not yet -PRON- do entreat and -PRON- do dare sir to be forbear
shall -PRON- not understand each other good than hitherto captain ahab

ahab seize a loaded musket from the rack form part of most
south sea man 's cabin furniture and point -PRON- towards starbuck
exclaim there be one god that be lord over the earth and one
captain that be lord over the pequod on deck

for an instant in the flashing eye of the mate and -PRON- fiery cheek
-PRON- would have almost think that -PRON- have really receive the blaze of
the levelled tube but master -PRON- emotion -PRON- half calmly rise
and as -PRON- quit the cabin pause for an instant and say thou hast
outraged not insult -PRON- sir but for that -PRON- ask thee not to beware of
starbuck thou wouldst but laugh but let ahab beware of ahab beware of
thyself old man

-PRON- wax brave but nevertheless obey most careful bravery that
murmur ahab as starbuck disappear what be that -PRON- say ahab
beware of ahab there be something there then unconsciously use the
musket for a staff with an iron brow -PRON- pace to and fro in the little
cabin but presently the thick plait of -PRON- forehead relaxed and
return the gun to the rack -PRON- go to the deck

thou art but too good a fellow starbuck -PRON- say lowly to the mate
then raise -PRON- voice to the crew furl the t'gallant sail and
close reef the top sail fore and aft back the main yard up burton
and break out in the main hold

-PRON- be perhaps vain to surmise exactly why -PRON- be that as respect
starbuck ahab thus act -PRON- may have be a flash of honesty in -PRON-
or mere prudential policy which under the circumstance imperiously
forbid the slight symptom of open disaffection however transient
in the important chief officer of -PRON- ship however -PRON- be -PRON- order
be execute and the burtons be hoist



chapter 110 queequeg in -PRON- coffin


upon search -PRON- be find that the cask last strike into the hold
be perfectly sound and that the leak must be further off so -PRON-
be calm weather -PRON- break out deep and deep disturb the
slumber of the huge ground tier butts and from that black midnight
send those gigantic mole into the daylight above so deep do -PRON-
go and so ancient and corrode and weedy the aspect of the lowermost
puncheon that -PRON- almost look next for some mouldy corner stone cask
contain coin of captain noah with copy of the post placard
vainly warn the infatuated old world from the flood tierce after
tierce too of water and bread and beef and shook of stave and
iron bundle of hoop be hoist out till at last the pile deck
be hard to get about and the hollow hull echo under foot as if
-PRON- be tread over empty catacombs and reel and roll in the sea
like an air freight demijohn top heavy be the ship as a dinnerless
student with all aristotle in -PRON- head well be -PRON- that the typhoons
do not visit -PRON- then

now at this time -PRON- be that -PRON- poor pagan companion and fast
bosom friend queequeg be seize with a fever which bring -PRON- nigh
to -PRON- endless end

be -PRON- say that in this vocation of whaling sinecure be unknown
dignity and danger go hand in hand till -PRON- get to be captain the
higher -PRON- rise the harder -PRON- toil so with poor queequeg who as
harpooneer must not only face all the rage of the live whale but as
-PRON- have elsewhere see mount -PRON- dead back in a roll sea and
finally descend into the gloom of the hold and bitterly sweat
all day in that subterraneous confinement resolutely manhandle the
clumsy cask and see to -PRON- stowage to be short among whaleman
the harpooneer be the holder so call

poor queequeg when the ship be about half disembowel -PRON- should
have stoop over the hatchway and peer down upon -PRON- there where
strip to -PRON- woollen drawer the tattooed savage be crawl about
amid that dampness and slime like a green spot lizard at the bottom
of a well and a well or an ice house -PRON- somehow prove to -PRON- poor
pagan where strange to say for all the heat of -PRON- sweating -PRON-
catch a terrible chill which lapse into a fever and at last after
some day suffering lay -PRON- in -PRON- hammock close to the very sill
of the door of death how -PRON- waste and waste away in those few
long linger day till there seem but little left of -PRON- but -PRON-
frame and tattooing but as all else in -PRON- thin and -PRON- cheek bone
grow sharp -PRON- eye nevertheless seem grow full and full
-PRON- become of a strange softness of lustre and mildly but deeply
look out at -PRON- there from -PRON- sickness a wondrous testimony to that
immortal health in -PRON- which could not die or be weaken and like
circle on the water which as -PRON- grow fainter expand so -PRON- eye
seem round and round like the ring of eternity an awe that
can not be name would steal over -PRON- as -PRON- sit by the side of this
wan savage and see as strange thing in -PRON- face as any beheld who
be bystander when zoroaster die for whatev be truly wondrous and
fearful in man never yet be put into word or book and the drawing
near of death which alike level all alike impress all with a last
revelation which only an author from the dead could adequately tell
so that let -PRON- say -PRON- again no die chaldee or greek have high and
holy thought than those whose mysterious shade -PRON- see creep
over the face of poor queequeg as -PRON- quietly lie in -PRON- sway
hammock and the roll sea seem gently rock -PRON- to -PRON- final
rest and the ocean 's invisible flood tide lift -PRON- high and high
towards -PRON- destine heaven

not a man of the crew but give -PRON- up and as for queequeg -PRON-
what -PRON- think of -PRON- case be forcibly show by a curious favour -PRON-
ask -PRON- call one to -PRON- in the grey morning watch when the day be
just break and take -PRON- hand say that while in nantucket -PRON-
have chance to see certain little canoe of dark wood like the rich
war wood of -PRON- native isle and upon inquiry -PRON- have learn that all
whaleman who die in nantucket be lay in those same dark canoe
and that the fancy of be so lay have much pleased -PRON- for -PRON- be not
unlike the custom of -PRON- own race who after embalm a dead warrior
stretch -PRON- out in -PRON- canoe and so leave -PRON- to be float away to
the starry archipelago for not only do -PRON- believe that the star
be isle but that far beyond all visible horizon -PRON- own mild
uncontinented sea interflow with the blue heavens and so form the
white breaker of the milky way -PRON- add that -PRON- shudder at
the thought of be bury in -PRON- hammock accord to the usual
sea custom toss like something vile to the death devour shark
no -PRON- desire a canoe like those of nantucket all the more congenial
to -PRON- be a whaleman that like a whale boat these coffin canoe
be without a keel though that involve but uncertain steering and
much lee way adown the dim age

now when this strange circumstance be make known aft the carpenter
be at once command to do queequeg 's bidding whatev -PRON- may
include there be some heathenish coffin coloured old lumber aboard
which upon a long previous voyage have be cut from the aboriginal
grove of the lackaday island and from these dark plank the coffin
be recommend to be make no sooner be the carpenter apprise of
the order than take -PRON- rule -PRON- forthwith with all the indifferent
promptitude of -PRON- character proceed into the forecastle and take
queequeg 's measure with great accuracy regularly chalk queequeg 's
person as -PRON- shift the rule

ah poor fellow -PRON- will have to die now ejaculate the long island
sailor

go to -PRON- vice bench the carpenter for convenience sake and general
reference now transferringly measure on -PRON- the exact length the coffin
be to be and then make the transfer permanent by cut two notch
at -PRON- extremity this do -PRON- marshal the plank and -PRON- tool
and to work

when the last nail be drive and the lid duly plan and fit
-PRON- lightly shoulder the coffin and go forward with -PRON- inquire
whether -PRON- be ready for -PRON- yet in that direction

overhear the indignant but half humorous cry with which the
people on deck begin to drive the coffin away queequeg to every one 's
consternation command that the thing should be instantly bring to
-PRON- nor be there any deny -PRON- see that of all mortal some
die man be the most tyrannical and certainly since -PRON- will
shortly trouble -PRON- so little for evermore the poor fellow ought to be
indulge

lean over in -PRON- hammock queequeg long regard the coffin with
an attentive eye -PRON- then call for -PRON- harpoon have the wooden stock
draw from -PRON- and then have the iron part place in the coffin along
with one of the paddle of -PRON- boat all by -PRON- own request also
biscuit be then range round the side within a flask of fresh water
be place at the head and a small bag of woody earth scrap up in
the hold at the foot and a piece of sail cloth being roll up for a
pillow queequeg now entreat to be lift into -PRON- final bed that -PRON-
may make trial of -PRON- comfort if any -PRON- have -PRON- lie without move
a few minute then tell one to go to -PRON- bag and bring out -PRON- little
god yojo then cross -PRON- arm on -PRON- breast with yojo between -PRON-
call for the coffin lid hatch -PRON- call -PRON- to be place over -PRON-
the head part turn over with a leather hinge and there lie queequeg
in -PRON- coffin with little but -PRON- compose countenance in view rarmai
-PRON- will do -PRON- be easy -PRON- murmur at last and sign to be replace
in -PRON- hammock

but ere this be do pip who have be slily hover near by all this
while draw nigh to -PRON- where -PRON- lie and with soft sobbing take -PRON-
by the hand in the other hold -PRON- tambourine

poor rover will ye never have do with all this weary rove where
go ye now but if the current carry ye to those sweet antilles where
the beach be only beat with water lily will ye do one little
errand for -PRON- seek out one pip who be now be miss long -PRON- think
-PRON- be in those far antilles if ye find -PRON- then comfort -PRON- for -PRON-
must be very sad for look -PRON- be leave -PRON- tambourine behind -PRON- find
-PRON- rig a dig dig dig now queequeg die and -PRON- will beat ye -PRON- die
march

-PRON- have hear murmur starbuck gaze down the scuttle that in
violent fever man all ignorance have talk in ancient tongue
and that when the mystery be probe -PRON- turn out always that in -PRON-
wholly forget childhood those ancient tongue have be really speak
in -PRON- hearing by some lofty scholar so to -PRON- fond faith poor pip
in this strange sweetness of -PRON- lunacy bring heavenly voucher of all
-PRON- heavenly home where learn -PRON- that but there hark -PRON- speak
again but more wildly now

form two and two let 's make a general of -PRON- ho where be -PRON- harpoon
lay -PRON- across here rig a dig dig dig huzza oh for a game cock
now to sit upon -PRON- head and crow queequeg die game!--mind ye that
queequeg die game!--take ye good heed of that queequeg die game -PRON-
say game game game but base little pip -PRON- die a coward die all
a'shiver out upon pip hark ye if ye find pip tell all the antilles
-PRON- be a runaway a coward a coward a coward tell -PRON- -PRON- jump from
a whale boat -PRON- would never beat -PRON- tambourine over base pip and hail
-PRON- general if -PRON- be once more die here no no shame upon all
coward shame upon -PRON- let 'em go drown like pip that jump from a
whale boat shame shame

during all this queequeg lie with closed eye as if in a dream pip
be lead away and the sick man be replace in -PRON- hammock

but now that -PRON- have apparently make every preparation for death now
that -PRON- coffin be prove a good fit queequeg suddenly rally soon
there seem no need of the carpenter 's box and thereupon when some
express -PRON- delighted surprise -PRON- in substance say that the
cause of -PRON- sudden convalescence be this at a critical moment -PRON-
have just recall a little duty ashore which -PRON- be leave undone
and therefore have change -PRON- mind about die -PRON- could not die yet
-PRON- aver -PRON- ask -PRON- then whether to live or die be a matter of
-PRON- own sovereign will and pleasure -PRON- answer certainly in a word
-PRON- be queequeg 's conceit that if a man make up -PRON- mind to live mere
sickness could not kill -PRON- nothing but a whale or a gale or some
violent ungovernable unintelligent destroyer of that sort

now there be this noteworthy difference between savage and civilized
that while a sick civilized man may be six month convalesce
generally speak a sick savage be almost half well again in a day
so in good time -PRON- queequeg gain strength and at length after
sit on the windlass for a few indolent day but eat with a
vigorous appetite -PRON- suddenly leap to -PRON- foot throw out -PRON- arm
and leg give -PRON- a good stretching yawn a little bit and then
spring into the head of -PRON- hoist boat and poise a harpoon
pronounce -PRON- fit for a fight

with a wild whimsiness -PRON- now use -PRON- coffin for a sea chest and
empty into -PRON- -PRON- canvas bag of clothe set -PRON- in order there
many spare hour -PRON- spend in carve the lid with all manner of
grotesque figure and drawing and -PRON- seem that hereby -PRON- be
strive in -PRON- rude way to copy part of the twisted tattooing on
-PRON- body and this tattooing have be the work of a depart prophet and
seer of -PRON- island who by those hieroglyphic mark have write out on
-PRON- body a complete theory of the heaven and the earth and a mystical
treatise on the art of attain truth so that queequeg in -PRON- own
proper person be a riddle to unfold a wondrous work in one volume but
whose mystery not even -PRON- could read though -PRON- own live heart
beat against -PRON- and these mystery be therefore destine in
the end to moulder away with the live parchment whereon -PRON- be
inscribe and so be unsolved to the last and this think -PRON- must
have be which suggest to ahab that wild exclamation of -PRON- when
one morning turn away from survey poor queequeg--"oh devilish
tantalization of the god



chapter 111 the pacific


when glide by the bashee isle -PRON- emerge at last upon the great south
sea be -PRON- not for other thing -PRON- could have greet -PRON- dear pacific
with uncounted thank for now the long supplication of -PRON- youth be
answer that serene ocean roll eastwards from -PRON- a thousand league
of blue

there be one know not what sweet mystery about this sea whose gently
awful stirring seem to speak of some hidden soul beneath like those
fabled undulation of the ephesian sod over the bury evangelist st.
john and meet -PRON- be that over these sea pasture wide roll watery
prairie and potter field of all four continent the wave should
rise and fall and ebb and flow unceasingly for here million of mixed
shade and shadow drown dream somnambulism reverie all that
-PRON- call life and soul lie dreaming dream still toss like
slumberer in -PRON- bed the ever roll wave but make so by -PRON-
restlessness

to any meditative magian rover this serene pacific once beheld must
ever after be the sea of -PRON- adoption -PRON- roll the midmost water of
the world the indian ocean and atlantic be but -PRON- arm the same
wave wash the mole of the new build californian town but yesterday
plant by the recentest race of man and lave the fade but still
gorgeous skirt of asiatic land old than abraham while all between
float milky way of coral isle and low lie endless unknown
archipelagoes and impenetrable japans thus this mysterious divine
pacific zone the world 's whole bulk about make all coast one bay
to -PRON- seem the tide beat heart of earth lift by those eternal
swell -PRON- need must own the seductive god bow -PRON- head to pan

but few thought of pan stir ahab 's brain as stand like an
iron statue at -PRON- accustomed place beside the mizen rigging with one
nostril -PRON- unthinkingly snuff the sugary musk from the bashee isle
in whose sweet wood mild lover must be walk and with the other
consciously inhale the salt breath of the new find sea that sea in
which the hat white whale must even then be swim launch at
length upon these almost final water and glide towards the japanese
cruise ground the old man 's purpose intensify -PRON- -PRON- firm lip
meet like the lip of a vice the delta of -PRON- forehead 's vein swell
like overladen brook in -PRON- very sleep -PRON- ring cry run through
the vault hull stern all the white whale spout thick blood



chapter 112 the blacksmith


avail -PRON- of the mild summer cool weather that now reign in
these latitude and in preparation for the peculiarly active
pursuit shortly to be anticipate perth the begrime blister old
blacksmith have not remove -PRON- portable forge to the hold again after
conclude -PRON- contributory work for ahab 's leg but still retain
-PRON- on deck fast lash to ringbolt by the foremast be now almost
incessantly invoke by the headsman and harpooneer and bowsman to do
some little job for -PRON- alter or repair or new shape -PRON-
various weapon and boat furniture often -PRON- would be surround by an
eager circle all wait to be serve hold boat spade pike head
harpoon and lance and jealously watch -PRON- every sooty movement
as -PRON- toil nevertheless this old man 's be a patient hammer wield
by a patient arm no murmur no impatience no petulance do come from
-PRON- silent slow and solemn bow over still further -PRON- chronically
break back -PRON- toil away as if toil be life -PRON- and the
heavy beating of -PRON- hammer the heavy beating of -PRON- heart and so -PRON-
be most miserable

a peculiar walk in this old man a certain slight but painful appear
yaw in -PRON- gait have at an early period of the voyage excite the
curiosity of the mariner and to the importunity of -PRON- persist
questioning -PRON- have finally give in and so -PRON- come to pass that every
one now know the shameful story of -PRON- wretched fate

belat and not innocently one bitter winter 's midnight on the road
run between two country town the blacksmith half stupidly feel
the deadly numbness steal over -PRON- and seek refuge in a leaning
dilapidated barn the issue be the loss of the extremity of both
foot out of this revelation part by part at last come out the four
act of the gladness and the one long and as yet uncatastrophi fifth
act of the grief of -PRON- life 's drama

-PRON- be an old man who at the age of nearly sixty have postponedly
encounter that thing in sorrow 's technical call ruin -PRON- have be
an artisan of famed excellence and with plenty to do own a house
and garden embrace a youthful daughter like love wife and three
blithe ruddy child every sunday go to a cheerful look church
plant in a grove but one night under cover of darkness and further
conceal in a most cunning disguisement a desperate burglar slide into
-PRON- happy home and rob -PRON- all of everything and dark yet to
tell the blacksmith -PRON- do ignorantly conduct this burglar into
-PRON- family 's heart -PRON- be the bottle conjuror upon the opening of that
fatal cork forth fly the fiend and shrivel up -PRON- home now for
prudent most wise and economic reason the blacksmith 's shop be in
the basement of -PRON- dwelling but with a separate entrance to -PRON- so
that always have the young and loving healthy wife listen with no
unhappy nervousness but with vigorous pleasure to the stout ringing of
-PRON- young armed old husband 's hammer whose reverberation muffle by
pass through the floor and wall come up to -PRON- not unsweetly
in -PRON- nursery and so to stout labor 's iron lullaby the blacksmith 's
infant be rock to slumber

oh woe on woe oh death why canst thou not sometimes be timely hadst
thou take this old blacksmith to thyself ere -PRON- full ruin come upon
-PRON- then have the young widow have a delicious grief and -PRON- orphan a
truly venerable legendary sire to dream of in -PRON- after year and
all of -PRON- a care kill competency but death pluck down some
virtuous eld brother on whose whistle daily toil solely hang the
responsibility of some other family and leave the bad than useless
old man stand till the hideous rot of life should make -PRON- easy to
harvest

why tell the whole the blow of the basement hammer every day grow more
and more between and each blow every day grow fainter than the last
the wife sit freeze at the window with tearless eye glitteringly
gaze into the weeping face of -PRON- child the bellow fall the
forge choke up with cinder the house be sell the mother dive
down into the long church yard grass -PRON- child twice follow -PRON-
thither and the houseless familyless old man stagger off a vagabond
in crape -PRON- every woe unreverenc -PRON- grey head a scorn to flaxen
curl

death seem the only desirable sequel for a career like this but death
be only a launching into the region of the strange untried -PRON- be but
the first salutation to the possibility of the immense remote the
wild the watery the unshored therefore to the death longing eye of
such man who still have leave in -PRON- some interior compunction against
suicide do the all contribute and all receptive ocean alluringly
spread forth -PRON- whole plain of unimaginable take terror and
wonderful new life adventure and from the heart of infinite
pacific the thousand mermaid s to them--"come hither
break hearted here be another life without the guilt of intermediate
death here be wonder supernatural without die for -PRON- come
hither bury thyself in a life which to -PRON- now equally abhorred and
abhor land world be more oblivious than death come hither put
up thy gravestone too within the churchyard and come hither till -PRON-
marry thee

hearken to these voice east and west by early sunrise and by fall
of eve the blacksmith 's soul respond aye -PRON- come and so perth go
a whaling

when at last the twelve rod be make ahab try -PRON- one by one by
spiral -PRON- with -PRON- own hand round a long heavy iron bolt a
flaw reject the last one work that over again perth

this do perth be about to begin weld the twelve into one when
ahab stay -PRON- hand and say -PRON- would weld -PRON- own iron as then
with regular gasp hem -PRON- hammer on the anvil perth pass to
-PRON- the glowing rod one after the other and the hard press forge
shoot up -PRON- intense straight flame the parsee pass silently and
bow over -PRON- head towards the fire seem invoke some curse or
some blessing on the toil but as ahab look up -PRON- slide aside

what be that bunch of lucifer dodge about there for mutter stubb
look on from the forecastle that parsee smell fire like a fusee
and smell of -PRON- -PRON- like a hot musket 's powder pan

at last the shank in one complete rod receive -PRON- final heat and as
perth to temper -PRON- plunge -PRON- all hiss into the cask of water near
by the scalding steam shot up into ahab 's bent face

would'st thou brand -PRON- perth wince for a moment with the pain

bend over -PRON- and see no stranding ahab exclaim good and
now for the seizing

at one extremity the rope be unstranded and the separate spread yarn
be all braid and weave round the socket of the harpoon the pole
be then drive hard up into the socket from the lower end the rope
be trace half way along the pole 's length and firmly secure so with
intertwisting of twine this do pole iron and rope like the three
fate remain inseparable and ahab moodily stalk away with the
weapon the sound of -PRON- ivory leg and the sound of the hickory pole
both hollowly ringing along every plank but ere -PRON- enter -PRON- cabin
light unnatural half banter yet most piteous sound be hear oh
pip thy wretched laugh thy idle but unresting eye all thy strange
mummery not unmeaningly blend with the black tragedy of the
melancholy ship and mock -PRON-



chapter 114 the gilder


penetrate further and further into the heart of the japanese cruise
ground the pequod be soon all astir in the fishery often in mild
pleasant weather for twelve fifteen eighteen and twenty hour on the
stretch -PRON- be engage in the boat steadily pull or sailing
or paddle after the whale or for an interlude of sixty or seventy
minute calmly await -PRON- uprising though with but small success
for -PRON- pain

at such time under an abate sun afloat all day upon smooth slow
heave swell seat in -PRON- boat light as a birch canoe and so
sociably mix with the soft wave -PRON- that like hearth stone
cat -PRON- purr against the gunwale these be the time of dreamy
quietude when behold the tranquil beauty and brilliancy of the
ocean 's skin one forget the tiger heart that pant beneath -PRON- and
would not willingly remember that this velvet paw but conceal a
remorseless fang

these be the time when in -PRON- whale boat the rover softly feel a
certain filial confident land like feeling towards the sea that -PRON-
regard -PRON- as so much flowery earth and the distant ship reveal
only the top of -PRON- mast seem struggle forward not through high
roll wave but through the tall grass of a roll prairie as when
the western emigrant horse only show -PRON- erect ear while -PRON-
hide body widely wade through the amazing verdure

the long draw virgin vale the mild blue hill side as over these
there steal the hush the hum -PRON- almost swear that play weary
child lie sleep in these solitude in some glad may time when
the flower of the wood be pluck and all this mix with -PRON- most
mystic mood so that fact and fancy half way meeting interpenetrate
and form one seamless whole

nor do such soothe scene however temporary fail of at least as
temporary an effect on ahab but if these secret golden key do seem
to open in -PRON- -PRON- own secret golden treasury yet do -PRON- breath upon
-PRON- prove but tarnish

oh grassy glade oh ever vernal endless landscape in the soul in
ye though long parch by the dead drought of the earthy life in ye
man yet may roll like young horse in new morning clover and for some
few fleeting moment feel the cool dew of the life immortal on -PRON-
would to god these bless calm would last but the mingled mingle
thread of life be weave by warp and woof calm cross by storm a
storm for every calm there be no steady unretracing progress in this
life -PRON- do not advance through fix gradation and at the last one
pause through infancy 's unconscious spell boyhood 's thoughtless
faith adolescence doubt the common doom then scepticism then
disbelief rest at last in manhood 's ponder repose of if but once
go through -PRON- trace the round again and be infant boy and man
and ifs eternally where lie the final harbor whence -PRON- unmoor no
more in what rapt ether sail the world of which the weary will
never weary where be the foundling 's father hide -PRON- soul be like
those orphan whose unwedded mother die in bear -PRON- the secret of
-PRON- paternity lie in -PRON- grave and -PRON- must there to learn -PRON-

and that same day too gaze far down from -PRON- boat 's side into that
same golden sea starbuck lowly murmured:--

loveliness unfathomable as ever lover see in -PRON- young bride 's
eye!--tell -PRON- not of thy tooth tier shark and thy kidnapping
cannibal way let faith oust fact let fancy oust memory -PRON- look deep
down and do believe

and stubb fish like with sparkling scale leap up in that same
golden light:--

-PRON- be stubb and stubb have -PRON- history but here stubb take oath that
-PRON- have always be jolly



chapter 115 the pequod meets the bachelor


and jolly enough be the sight and the sound that come bear down
before the wind some few week after ahab 's harpoon have be weld

-PRON- be a nantucket ship the bachelor which have just wedge in -PRON-
last cask of oil and bolt down -PRON- bursting hatch and now in glad
holiday apparel be joyously though somewhat vain gloriously sail
round among the widely separate ship on the ground previous to
point -PRON- prow for home

the three man at -PRON- mast head wear long streamer of narrow red bunting
at -PRON- hat from the stern a whale boat be suspend bottom down
and hang captive from the bowsprit be see the long low jaw of the
last whale -PRON- have slay signal ensign and jack of all colour
be fly from -PRON- rigging on every side sideways lash in each of
-PRON- three basketed top be two barrel of sperm above which in -PRON-
top mast cross tree -PRON- see slender breaker of the same precious
fluid and nail to -PRON- main truck be a brazen lamp

as be afterwards learn the bachelor have meet with the most surprising
success all the more wonderful for that while cruise in the same
sea numerous other vessel have go entire month without secure a
single fish not only have barrel of beef and bread be give away to
make room for the far more valuable sperm but additional supplemental
cask have be barter for from the ship -PRON- have meet and these be
stow along the deck and in the captain 's and officer state room
even the cabin table -PRON- have be knock into kindle wood and the
cabin mess din off the broad head of an oil butt lash down to the
floor for a centrepiece in the forecastle the sailor have actually
caulk and pitch -PRON- chest and fill -PRON- -PRON- be humorously
add that the cook have clap a head on -PRON- large boiler and
fill -PRON- that the steward have plug -PRON- spare coffee pot and fill
-PRON- that the harpooneer have head the socket of -PRON- iron and
fill -PRON- that indeed everything be fill with sperm except the
captain 's pantaloon pocket and those -PRON- reserve to thrust -PRON- hand
into in self complacent testimony of -PRON- entire satisfaction

as this glad ship of good luck bear down upon the moody pequod the
barbarian sound of enormous drum come from -PRON- forecastle and draw
still nearer a crowd of -PRON- man be see stand round -PRON- huge
try pot which cover with the parchment like poke or stomach skin of
the black fish give forth a loud roar to every stroke of the clenched
hand of the crew on the quarter deck the mate and harpooneer be
dance with the olive hue girl who have elope with -PRON- from the
polynesian isles while suspend in an ornamented boat firmly secure
aloft between the foremast and mainmast three long island negro with
glitter fiddle bow of whale ivory be preside over the hilarious
jig meanwhile other of the ship 's company be tumultuously busy at
the masonry of the try work from which the huge pot have be
remove -PRON- would have almost think -PRON- be pull down the curse
bastille such wild cry -PRON- raise as the now useless brick and
mortar be be hurl into the sea

lord and master over all this scene the captain stand erect on the
ship 's elevated quarter deck so that the whole rejoicing drama be
full before -PRON- and seem merely contrive for -PRON- own individual
diversion

and ahab -PRON- too be stand on -PRON- quarter deck shaggy and black
with a stubborn gloom and as the two ship cross each other 's
wake one all jubilation for thing pass the other all foreboding
as to thing to come -PRON- two captain in -PRON- impersonate the
whole striking contrast of the scene

come aboard come aboard cry the gay bachelor 's commander lift
a glass and a bottle in the air

hast see the white whale grit ahab in reply

no only hear of -PRON- but do not believe in -PRON- at all say the other
good humoredly come aboard

thou art too damned jolly sail on hast lose any man

not enough to speak of two islander that be all but come aboard
old hearty come along -PRON- will soon take that black from -PRON- brow come
along will ye merry 's the play a full ship and homeward bind

how wondrous familiar be a fool mutter ahab then aloud thou art
a full ship and homeward bind thou sayst well then call -PRON- an empty
ship and outward bind so go thy way and -PRON- will -PRON- forward there
set all sail and keep -PRON- to the wind

and thus while the one ship go cheerily before the breeze the other
stubbornly fight against -PRON- and so the two vessel part the crew
of the pequod look with grave linger glance towards the recede
bachelor but the bachelor 's man never heed -PRON- gaze for the lively
revelry -PRON- be in and as ahab lean over the taffrail eye the
homewardbound craft -PRON- take from -PRON- pocket a small vial of sand and
then look from the ship to the vial seem thereby bring two
remote association together for that vial be fill with nantucket
sounding



chapter 116 the dying whale


not seldom in this life when on the right side fortune 's favourite
sail close by -PRON- -PRON- though all adroop before catch somewhat of the
rush breeze and joyfully feel -PRON- bag sail fill out so seem
-PRON- with the pequod for next day after encounter the gay bachelor
whale be see and four be slay and one of -PRON- by ahab

-PRON- be far down the afternoon and when all the spearing of the crimson
fight be do and float in the lovely sunset sea and sky sun
and whale both stilly die together then such a sweetness and such
plaintiveness such inwreathing orison curl up in that rosy air that
-PRON- almost seem as if far over from the deep green convent valley of
the manilla isle the spanish land breeze wantonly turn sailor have
go to sea freight with these vesper hymn

soothe again but only soothe to deep gloom ahab who have stern
off from the whale sit intently watch -PRON- final waning from the now
tranquil boat for that strange spectacle observable in all sperm whale
die the turning sunward of the head and so expiring that strange
spectacle beheld of such a placid evening somehow to ahab convey a
wondrousness unknown before

-PRON- turn and turn -PRON- to -PRON- how slowly but how steadfastly -PRON-
homage render and invoke brow with -PRON- last dying motion -PRON- too
worship fire most faithful broad baronial vassal of the sun!--oh
that these too favour eye should see these too favour sight
look here far water lock beyond all hum of human weal or woe
in these most candid and impartial sea where to tradition no rock
furnish tablet where for long chinese age the billow have still
roll on speechless and unspoken to as star that shine upon the
niger 's unknown source here too life die sunward full of faith but
see no sooner dead than death whirl round the corpse and -PRON- head
some other way

oh thou dark hindoo half of nature who of drown bone hast build
thy separate throne somewhere in the heart of these unverdured sea
thou art an infidel thou queen and too truly speak to -PRON- in the
wide slaughtering typhoon and the hush burial of -PRON- after calm nor
have this thy whale sunward turn -PRON- dying head and then go round
again without a lesson to -PRON-

oh trebly hoop and weld hip of power oh high aspiring rainbow
jet!--that one strivest this one jettest all in vain in vain oh
whale dost thou seek interceding with yon all quicken sun that
only call forth life but give -PRON- not again yet dost thou dark
half rock -PRON- with a prouder if a dark faith all thy unnamable
immingling float beneath -PRON- here -PRON- be buoy by breath of once live
thing exhale as air but water now

then hail for ever hail o sea in whose eternal tossing the wild
fowl find -PRON- only rest bear of earth yet suckle by the sea though
hill and valley mother -PRON- ye billow be -PRON- foster brother



chapter 117 the whale watch


the four whale slay that evening have die wide apart one far to
windward one less distant to leeward one ahead one astern these
last three be bring alongside ere nightfall but the windward one
could not be reach till morning and the boat that have kill -PRON- lie
by -PRON- side all night and that boat be ahab 's

the waif pole be thrust upright into the dead whale 's spout hole and
the lantern hang from -PRON- top cast a troubled flickering glare
upon the black glossy back and far out upon the midnight wave which
gently chafe the whale 's broad flank like soft surf upon a beach

ahab and all -PRON- boat 's crew seem asleep but the parsee who crouch
in the bow sit watch the shark that spectrally play round the
whale and tap the light cedar plank with -PRON- tail a sound
like the moaning in squadron over asphaltites of unforgiven ghost of
gomorrah run shudder through the air

start from -PRON- slumber ahab face to face see the parsee and
hoop round by the gloom of the night -PRON- seem the last man in a
flood world -PRON- have dream -PRON- again say -PRON-

of the hearse have -PRON- not say old man that neither hearse nor
coffin can be thine

and who be hears that die on the sea

but -PRON- say old man that ere thou couldst die on this voyage two
hearse must verily be see by thee on the sea the first not make by
mortal hand and the visible wood of the last one must be grow in
america

aye aye a strange sight that parsee a hearse and -PRON- plume
float over the ocean with the wave for the pall bearer ha such a
sight -PRON- shall not soon see

believe -PRON- or not thou canst not die till -PRON- be see old man

and what be that saying about thyself

though -PRON- come to the last -PRON- shall still go before thee thy pilot

and when thou art so go before if that ever befall then ere -PRON- can
follow thou must still appear to -PRON- to pilot -PRON- still be -PRON- not
so well then do -PRON- believe all ye say oh my pilot -PRON- have here two
pledge that -PRON- shall yet slay moby dick and survive -PRON-

take another pledge old man say the parsee as -PRON- eye light up
like fire fly in the gloom--"hemp only can kill thee

the gallow ye mean -PRON- be immortal then on land and on sea cry
ahab with a laugh of derision;--"immortal on land and on sea

both be silent again as one man the grey dawn come on and the
slumber crew arise from the boat 's bottom and ere noon the dead
whale be bring to the ship



chapter 118 the quadrant


the season for the line at length draw near and every day when ahab
come from -PRON- cabin cast -PRON- eye aloft the vigilant helmsman would
ostentatiously handle -PRON- spoke and the eager mariner quickly run to
the brace and would stand there with all -PRON- eye centrally fix
on the nail doubloon impatient for the order to point the ship 's
prow for the equator in good time the order come -PRON- be hard upon high
noon and ahab seat in the bow of -PRON- high hoist boat be
about take -PRON- wont daily observation of the sun to determine -PRON-
latitude

now in that japanese sea the day in summer be as freshet of
effulgence that unblinkingly vivid japanese sun seem the blazing
focus of the glassy ocean 's immeasurable burning glass the sky look
lacquer cloud there be none the horizon float and this nakedness
of unrelieved radiance be as the insufferable splendor of god 's throne
well that ahab 's quadrant be furnish with coloured glass through
which to take sight of that solar fire so swing -PRON- seat form
to the roll of the ship and with -PRON- astrological look instrument
place to -PRON- eye -PRON- remain in that posture for some moment to
catch the precise instant when the sun should gain -PRON- precise meridian
meantime while -PRON- whole attention be absorb the parsee be kneel
beneath -PRON- on the ship 's deck and with face throw up like ahab 's
be eye the same sun with -PRON- only the lid of -PRON- eye half hooded
-PRON- orb and -PRON- wild face be subdue to an earthly passionlessness
at length the desire observation be take and with -PRON- pencil upon
-PRON- ivory leg ahab soon calculate what -PRON- latitude must be at that
precise instant then fall into a moment 's revery -PRON- again look up
towards the sun and murmur to -PRON- thou sea mark thou high and
mighty pilot thou tellest -PRON- truly where -PRON- be but canst thou cast the
least hint where -PRON- shall be or canst thou tell where some other thing
besides -PRON- be this moment live where be moby dick this instant thou
must be eye -PRON- these eye of mine look into the very eye that be
even now behold -PRON- aye and into the eye that be even now equally
behold the object on the unknown thither side of thee thou sun

then gaze at -PRON- quadrant and handling one after the other -PRON-
numerous cabalistical contrivance -PRON- ponder again and mutter
foolish toy baby plaything of haughty admirals and commodores and
captain the world brag of thee of thy cunning and may but what
after all canst thou do but tell the poor pitiful point where thou
thyself happenest to be on this wide planet and the hand that hold
thee no not one jot more thou canst not tell where one drop of water
or one grain of sand will be to morrow noon and yet with thy impotence
thou insultest the sun science curse thee thou vain toy and curse
be all the thing that cast man 's eye aloft to that heaven whose live
vividness but scorch -PRON- as these old eye be even now scorch
with thy light o sun level by nature to this earth 's horizon be the
glance of man 's eye not shoot from the crown of -PRON- head as if god
have mean -PRON- to gaze on -PRON- firmament curse thee thou quadrant
dash -PRON- to the deck no longer will -PRON- guide -PRON- earthly way by thee
the level ship 's compass and the level deadreckoning by log and by
line these shall conduct -PRON- and show -PRON- -PRON- place on the sea aye
lighting from the boat to the deck thus -PRON- trample on thee thou paltry
thing that feebly pointest on high thus -PRON- split and destroy thee

as the frantic old man thus speak and thus trample with -PRON- live
and dead foot a sneering triumph that seem mean for ahab and a
fatalistic despair that seem mean for -PRON- these pass over
the mute motionless parsee 's face unobserved -PRON- rise and glide away
while awestruck by the aspect of -PRON- commander the seaman cluster
together on the forecastle till ahab troubledly pace the deck
shout out--"to the brace up helm!--square in

in an instant the yard swung round and as the ship half wheel upon
-PRON- heel -PRON- three firm seat graceful mast erectly poise upon
-PRON- long rib hull seem as the three horatii pirouette on one
sufficient steed

standing between the knight head starbuck watch the pequod 's
tumultuous way and ahab 's also as -PRON- go lurch along the deck

-PRON- have sit before the dense coal fire and watch -PRON- all aglow full of
-PRON- torment flaming life and -PRON- have see -PRON- wane at last down down
to dumb dust old man of ocean of all this fiery life of thine
what will at length remain but one little heap of ash

aye cry stubb but sea coal ash mind ye that mr.
starbuck sea coal not -PRON- common charcoal well well -PRON- hear ahab
mutter here some one thrust these card into these old hand of mine
swear that -PRON- must play -PRON- and no other and damn -PRON- ahab but
thou actest right live in the game and die in -PRON-



chapter 119 the candles


warm clime but nurse the cruell fang the tiger of bengal
crouch in spice grove of ceaseless verdure sky the most effulgent
but basket the deadly thunder gorgeous cuba know tornado
that never sweep tame northern land so too -PRON- be that in these
resplendent japanese sea the mariner encounter the dire of all
storm the typhoon -PRON- will sometimes burst from out that cloudless
sky like an explode bomb upon a dazed and sleepy town

towards evening of that day the pequod be tear of -PRON- canvas and
bare poled be leave to fight a typhoon which have strike -PRON- directly
ahead when darkness come on sky and sea roar and split with the
thunder and blaze with the lightning that show the disabled mast
flutter here and there with the rag which the first fury of the
tempest have leave for -PRON- after sport

holding by a shroud starbuck be stand on the quarter deck at every
flash of the lightning glance aloft to see what additional disaster
may have befall the intricate hamper there while stubb and flask
be direct the man in the high hoisting and firm lashing of the
boat but all -PRON- pain seem naught though lift to the very
top of the crane the windward quarter boat ahab 's do not escape
a great rolling sea dash high up against the reel ship 's high
teeter side stove in the boat 's bottom at the stern and leave -PRON-
again all drip through like a sieve

bad work bad work mr. starbuck say stubb regard the wreck
but the sea will have -PRON- way stubb for one can not fight -PRON- -PRON- see
mr. starbuck a wave have such a great long start before -PRON- leap all
round the world -PRON- run and then come the spring but as for -PRON- all
the start -PRON- have to meet -PRON- be just across the deck here but never
mind -PRON- be all in fun so the old song says;"--(sings

oh jolly be the gale
and a joker be the whale
a flourishin -PRON- tail,--
such a funny sporty gamy jesty joky hoky poky lad be the ocean oh

the scud all a flyin
that be -PRON- flip only foamin
when -PRON- stir in the spicin',--
such a funny sporty gamy jesty joky hoky poky lad be the ocean oh

thunder split the ship
but -PRON- only smack -PRON- lip
a tastin of this flip,--
such a funny sporty gamy jesty joky hoky poky lad be the ocean oh


avast stubb cry starbuck let the typhoon sing and strike -PRON-
harp here in -PRON- rigging but if thou art a brave man thou wilt hold thy
peace

but -PRON- be not a brave man never say -PRON- be a brave man -PRON- be a coward
and -PRON- s to keep up -PRON- spirit and -PRON- tell -PRON- what -PRON- be mr.
starbuck there be no way to stop -PRON- singing in this world but to cut -PRON-
throat and when that be do ten to one -PRON- s ye the doxology for a
wind up

madman look through -PRON- eye if thou hast none of thine own

what how can -PRON- see good of a dark night than anybody else never
mind how foolish

here cry starbuck seize stubb by the shoulder and point -PRON-
hand towards the weather bow mark thou not that the gale come from
the eastward the very course ahab be to run for moby dick the very
course -PRON- swing to this day noon now mark -PRON- boat there where be
that stove in the stern sheet man where -PRON- be will not to stand -PRON-
stand point be stove man now jump overboard and sing away if thou
must

-PRON- do not half understand ye what be in the wind

yes yes round the cape of good hope be the short way to
nantucket soliloquize starbuck suddenly heedless of stubb 's
question the gale that now hammer at -PRON- to stave -PRON- -PRON- can turn -PRON-
into a fair wind that will drive -PRON- towards home yonder to windward
all be blackness of doom but to leeward homeward -PRON- see -PRON- lighten up
there but not with the lightning

at that moment in one of the interval of profound darkness follow
the flash a voice be hear at -PRON- side and almost at the same
instant a volley of thunder peal roll overhead

who be there

old thunder say ahab grope -PRON- way along the bulwark to -PRON-
pivot hole but suddenly find -PRON- path make plain to -PRON- by elbow
lance of fire

now as the lightning rod to a spire on shore be intend to carry off
the perilous fluid into the soil so the kindred rod which at sea some
ship carry to each mast be intend to conduct -PRON- into the water but
as this conductor must descend to considerable depth that -PRON- end may
avoid all contact with the hull and as moreover if keep constantly
tow there -PRON- would be liable to many mishap besides interfere
not a little with some of the rigging and more or less impede the
vessel 's way in the water because of all this the low part of a
ship 's lightning rod be not always overboard but be generally make
in long slender link so as to be the more readily haul up into the
chain outside or throw down into the sea as occasion may require

the rod the rod cry starbuck to the crew suddenly admonish to
vigilance by the vivid lightning that have just be dart flambeaux
to light ahab to -PRON- post be -PRON- overboard drop -PRON- over fore and
aft quick

avast cry ahab let 's have fair play here though -PRON- be the weak
side yet -PRON- will contribute to raise rod on the himmalehs and andes that
all the world may be secure but out on privilege let -PRON- be sir

look aloft cry starbuck the corpusant the corpusant

all the yard arm be tip with a pallid fire and touch at each
tri point lightning rod end with three taper white flame each of
the three tall mast be silently burn in that sulphurous air like
three gigantic wax taper before an altar

blast the boat let -PRON- go cry stubb at this instant as a swashing
sea heave up under -PRON- own little craft so that -PRON- gunwale violently
jam -PRON- hand as -PRON- be pass a lashing blast it!"--but
slip backward on the deck -PRON- uplifted eye catch the flame and
immediately shift -PRON- tone -PRON- cried--"the corpusant have mercy on -PRON-
all

to sailor oath be household word -PRON- will swear in the trance of
the calm and in the tooth of the tempest -PRON- will imprecate curse
from the topsail yard arm when most -PRON- teeter over to a seethe
sea but in all -PRON- voyaging seldom have -PRON- hear a common oath when
god 's burn finger have be lay on the ship when -PRON- mene mene
tekel upharsin have be weave into the shroud and the cordage

while this pallidness be burn aloft few word be hear from the
enchanted crew who in one thick cluster stand on the forecastle
all -PRON- eye gleam in that pale phosphorescence like a far away
constellation of star relieve against the ghostly light the gigantic
jet negro daggoo loom up to thrice -PRON- real stature and seem
the black cloud from which the thunder have come the parted mouth of
tashtego reveal -PRON- shark white tooth which strangely gleam as
if -PRON- too have be tip by corpusant while light up by the
preternatural light queequeg 's tattooing burn like satanic blue
flame on -PRON- body

the tableau all wan at last with the pallidness aloft and once more
the pequod and every soul on -PRON- deck be wrap in a pall a moment
or two pass when starbuck go forward push against some one -PRON-
be stubb what thinkest thou now man -PRON- hear thy cry -PRON- be not the
same in the song

no no -PRON- be n't -PRON- say the corpusant have mercy on -PRON- all and -PRON-
hope -PRON- will still but do -PRON- only have mercy on long face have
-PRON- no bowel for a laugh and look ye mr. starbuck but -PRON- be too dark
to look hear -PRON- then -PRON- take that mast head flame -PRON- see for a sign
of good luck for those mast be root in a hold that be go to be
chock a block with sperm oil d'ye see and so all that sperm will
work up into the mast like sap in a tree yes -PRON- three mast will
yet be as three spermaceti candle that be the good promise -PRON- see

at that moment starbuck catch sight of stubb 's face slowly begin
to glimmer into sight glance upwards -PRON- cry see see and once
more the high tapering flame be behold with what seem redouble
supernaturalness in -PRON- pallor

the corpusant have mercy on -PRON- all cry stubb again

at the base of the mainmast full beneath the doubloon and the flame
the parsee be kneel in ahab 's front but with -PRON- head bow away
from -PRON- while near by from the arched and overhanging rigging where
-PRON- have just be engage secure a spar a number of the seamen
arrest by the glare now cohere together and hang pendulous like a
knot of numb wasp from a drooping orchard twig in various enchanted
attitude like the standing or step or run skeleton in
herculaneum other remain root to the deck but all -PRON- eye
upcast

aye aye man cry ahab look up at -PRON- mark -PRON- well the white
flame but light the way to the white whale hand -PRON- those mainmast
link there -PRON- would fain feel this pulse and let -PRON- beat against -PRON-
blood against fire so

then turn the last link hold fast in -PRON- left hand -PRON- put -PRON- foot
upon the parsee and with fix upward eye and high flung right arm -PRON-
stand erect before the lofty tri point trinity of flame

oh thou clear spirit of clear fire whom on these sea -PRON- as persian
once do worship till in the sacramental act so burn by thee that to
this hour -PRON- bear the scar -PRON- now know thee thou clear spirit and -PRON- now
know that thy right worship be defiance to neither love nor reverence
wilt thou be kind and e'en for hate thou canst but kill and all
be kill no fearless fool now front thee -PRON- own thy speechless
placeless power but to the last gasp of -PRON- earthquake life will
dispute -PRON- unconditional unintegral mastery in -PRON- in the midst of the
personify impersonal a personality stand here though but a point at
good whencesoe'er -PRON- come wheresoe'er -PRON- go yet while -PRON- earthly live
the queenly personality live in -PRON- and feel -PRON- royal right but war
be pain and hate be woe come in thy low form of love and -PRON- will
kneel and kiss thee but at thy high come as mere supernal power
and though thou launch navy of full freighted world there be that
in here that still remain indifferent oh thou clear spirit of thy
fire thou madest -PRON- and like a true child of fire -PRON- breathe -PRON- back to
thee

sudden repeated flashes of lightning the nine flames leap lengthwise
to thrice their previous height ahab with the rest closes his eye
his right hand press hard upon them

-PRON- own thy speechless placeless power say -PRON- not so nor be -PRON- wring
from -PRON- nor do -PRON- now drop these link thou canst blind but -PRON- can then

the boat the boat cry starbuck look at thy boat old man

ahab 's harpoon the one forge at perth 's fire remain firmly lash
in -PRON- conspicuous crotch so that -PRON- project beyond -PRON- whale boat 's
bow but the sea that have stove -PRON- bottom have cause the loose leather
sheath to drop off and from the keen steel barb there now come a
level flame of pale fork fire as the silent harpoon burn there
like a serpent 's tongue starbuck grasp ahab by the arm--"god god
be against thee old man forbear tis an ill voyage ill begin ill
continue let -PRON- square the yard while -PRON- may old man and make a
fair wind of -PRON- homewards to go on a good voyage than this

overhearing starbuck the panic stricken crew instantly run to the
brace though not a sail be leave aloft for the moment all the aghast
mate 's thought seem -PRON- -PRON- raise a half mutinous cry but
dash the rattle lightning link to the deck and snatch the
burn harpoon ahab wave -PRON- like a torch among -PRON- swear to
transfix with -PRON- the first sailor that but cast loose a rope 's end
petrify by -PRON- aspect and still more shrink from the fiery dart
that -PRON- hold the man fall back in dismay and ahab again spoke:--

all -PRON- oath to hunt the white whale be as binding as mine and
heart soul and body lung and life old ahab be bind and that ye
may know to what tune this heart beat look ye here thus -PRON- blow out
the last fear and with one blast of -PRON- breath -PRON- extinguish the
flame

as in the hurricane that sweep the plain man fly the neighborhood of
some lone gigantic elm whose very height and strength but render -PRON- so
much the more unsafe because so much the more a mark for thunderbolt
so at those last word of ahab 's many of the mariner do run from -PRON-
in a terror of dismay



chapter 120 the deck towards the end of the first night watch

ahab stand by the helm starbuck approach him


-PRON- must send down the main top sail yard sir the band be work loose
and the lee lift be half strand shall -PRON- strike -PRON- sir

strike nothing lash -PRON- if -PRON- have sky sail pole -PRON- would sway -PRON- up
now

sir!--in god 's name!--sir

well

the anchor be work sir shall -PRON- get -PRON- inboard

strike nothing and stir nothing but lash everything the wind rise
but -PRON- have not get up to -PRON- table land yet quick and see to -PRON- by
mast and keel -PRON- take -PRON- for the hunch back skipper of some
coast smack send down -PRON- main top sail yard ho gluepot lofty
truck be make for wild wind and this brain truck of -PRON- now
sail amid the cloud scud shall -PRON- strike that oh none but coward
send down -PRON- brain truck in tempest time what a hooroosh aloft
there -PRON- would e'en take -PRON- for sublime do -PRON- not know that the colic
be a noisy malady oh take medicine take medicine



chapter 121 midnight the forecastle bulwarks


stubb and flask mount on them and passing additional lashings over
the anchor there hanging


no stubb -PRON- may pound that knot there as much as -PRON- please but -PRON-
will never pound into -PRON- what -PRON- be just now say and how long
ago be -PRON- since -PRON- say the very contrary do not -PRON- once say that
whatev ship ahab sail in that ship should pay something extra on -PRON-
insurance policy just as though -PRON- be load with powder barrel aft
and box of lucifer forward stop now do not -PRON- say so

well suppose -PRON- do what then -PRON- have part change -PRON- flesh since that
time why not -PRON- mind besides suppose -PRON- be load with powder
barrel aft and lucifer forward how the devil could the lucifer get
afire in this drenching spray here why -PRON- little man -PRON- have
pretty red hair but -PRON- could not get afire now shake -PRON- -PRON- be
aquarius or the water bearer flask may fill pitcher at -PRON- coat
collar do not -PRON- see then that for these extra risk the marine
insurance company have extra guarantee here be hydrant flask but
hark again and -PRON- will answer ye the other thing first take -PRON- leg off
from the crown of the anchor here though so -PRON- can pass the rope
now listen what be the mighty difference between hold a mast 's
lightning rod in the storm and stand close by a mast that hasn't
get any lightning rod at all in a storm do not -PRON- see -PRON- timber head
that no harm can come to the holder of the rod unless the mast be first
strike what be -PRON- talk about then not one ship in a hundred
carry rod and ahab aye man and all of -PRON- be in no more
danger then in -PRON- poor opinion than all the crew in ten thousand
ship now sail the sea why -PRON- king post -PRON- -PRON- suppose -PRON- would
have every man in the world go about with a small lightning rod run
up the corner of -PRON- hat like a militia officer 's skewer feather
and trail behind like -PRON- sash why do not ye be sensible flask -PRON- be
easy to be sensible why do not ye then any man with half an eye can be
sensible

-PRON- do not know that stubb -PRON- sometimes find -PRON- rather hard

yes when a fellow 's soak through -PRON- be hard to be sensible that be
a fact and -PRON- be about drench with this spray never mind catch the
turn there and pass -PRON- seem to -PRON- -PRON- be lash down these anchor
now as if -PRON- be never go to be use again tie these two
anchor here flask seem like tie a man 's hand behind -PRON- and what
big generous hand -PRON- be to be sure these be -PRON- iron fist
hey what a hold -PRON- have too -PRON- wonder flask whether the world be
anchor anywhere if -PRON- be -PRON- swing with an uncommon long cable
though there hammer that knot down and -PRON- have do so next to
touch land light on deck be the most satisfactory -PRON- say just
wr out -PRON- jacket skirt will ye thank ye -PRON- laugh at long tog
so flask but seem to -PRON- a long tail coat ought always to be wear
in all storm afloat the tail taper down that way serve to carry
off the water d'ye see same with cocked hat the cock form gable end
eave trough flask no more monkey jacket and tarpaulin for -PRON- -PRON-
must mount a swallow tail and drive down a beaver so halloa whew
there go -PRON- tarpaulin overboard lord lord that the wind that come
from heaven should be so unmannerly this be a nasty night lad



chapter 122 midnight aloft thunder and lightning


the main top sail yard tashtego passing new lashings around it


um um um stop that thunder plenty too much thunder up here what be
the use of thunder um um um -PRON- do not want thunder -PRON- want rum give
-PRON- a glass of rum um um um



chapter 123 the musket


during the most violent shock of the typhoon the man at the pequod 's
jaw bone tiller have several time be reelingly hurl to the deck by
-PRON- spasmodic motion even though preventer tackle have be attach
to -PRON- for -PRON- be slack because some play to the tiller be
indispensable

in a severe gale like this while the ship be but a toss shuttlecock
to the blast -PRON- be by no mean uncommon to see the needle in the
compass at interval go round and round -PRON- be thus with the
pequod 's at almost every shock the helmsman have not fail to notice
the whirl velocity with which -PRON- revolve upon the card -PRON- be
a sight that hardly anyone can behold without some sort of unwonted
emotion

some hour after midnight the typhoon abate so much that through the
strenuous exertion of starbuck and stubb one engage forward and the
other aft the shivered remnant of the jib and fore and main top sail
be cut adrift from the spar and go eddy away to leeward like
the feather of an albatross which sometimes be cast to the wind when
that storm toss bird be on the wing

the three correspond new sail be now bent and reefed and a
storm trysail be set further aft so that the ship soon go through
the water with some precision again and the course for the present
east south east which -PRON- be to steer if practicable be once more
give to the helmsman for during the violence of the gale -PRON- have only
steer accord to -PRON- vicissitude but as -PRON- be now bring the
ship as near -PRON- course as possible watch the compass meanwhile lo
a good sign the wind seem come round astern aye the foul breeze
become fair

instantly the yard be square to the lively song of ho the
fair wind oh ye ho cheerly men the crew singing for joy that so
promise an event should so soon have falsify the evil portent
precede -PRON-

in compliance with the stand order of -PRON- commander to report
immediately and at any one of the twenty four hour any decide change
in the affair of the deck starbuck have no sooner trim the yard to
the breeze however reluctantly and gloomily than -PRON- mechanically go
below to apprise captain ahab of the circumstance

ere knock at -PRON- state room -PRON- involuntarily pause before -PRON-
a moment the cabin lamp take long swing this way and that be
burn fitfully and cast fitful shadow upon the old man 's bolt
door a thin one with fixed blind insert in place of upper panel
the isolated subterraneousness of the cabin make a certain humming
silence to reign there though -PRON- be hoop round by all the roar of
the element the loaded musket in the rack be shiningly reveal as
-PRON- stand upright against the forward bulkhead starbuck be an honest
upright man but out of starbuck 's heart at that instant when -PRON- see
the musket there strangely evolve an evil thought but so blent with
-PRON- neutral or good accompaniment that for the instant -PRON- hardly know
-PRON- for -PRON-

-PRON- would have shoot -PRON- once -PRON- murmur yes there be the very musket
that -PRON- point at -PRON- that one with the studded stock let -PRON- touch
-PRON- lift -PRON- strange that -PRON- who have handle so many deadly lance
strange that -PRON- should shake so now load -PRON- must see aye aye and
powder in the pan that be not good good spill -PRON- wait -PRON- will cure
-PRON- of this -PRON- will hold the musket boldly while -PRON- think -PRON- come
to report a fair wind to -PRON- but how fair fair for death and
doom that be fair for moby dick -PRON- be a fair wind that be only fair for
that accursed fish the very tube -PRON- point at me!--the very one
this one -PRON- hold -PRON- here -PRON- would have kill -PRON- with the very thing -PRON-
handle now aye and -PRON- would fain kill all -PRON- crew do -PRON- not say
-PRON- will not strike -PRON- spar to any gale have -PRON- not dash -PRON- heavenly
quadrant and in these same perilous sea grope -PRON- not -PRON- way by mere
dead reckoning of the error abound log and in this very typhoon do
-PRON- not swear that -PRON- would have no lightning rod but shall this crazed
old man be tamely suffer to drag a whole ship 's company down to doom
with -PRON- yes -PRON- would make -PRON- the wilful murderer of thirty man and
more if this ship come to any deadly harm and come to deadly harm -PRON-
soul swear this ship will if ahab have -PRON- way if then -PRON- be this
instant put aside that crime would not be -PRON- ha be -PRON- mutter in
-PRON- sleep yes just there in there -PRON- be sleep sleep aye
but still alive and soon awake again -PRON- can not withstand thee then old
man not reasoning not remonstrance not entreaty wilt thou hearken to
all this thou scornest flat obedience to thy own flat command this be
all thou breathest aye and say'st the man have vow'd thy vow say'st
all of -PRON- be ahabs great god forbid!--but be there no other way no
lawful way make -PRON- a prisoner to be take home what hope to wrest
this old man 's live power from -PRON- own live hand only a fool
would try -PRON- say -PRON- be pinion even knot all over with rope
and hawser chain down to ring bolt on this cabin floor -PRON- would
be more hideous than a caged tiger then -PRON- could not endure the
sight could not possibly fly -PRON- howling all comfort sleep -PRON-
inestimable reason would leave -PRON- on the long intolerable voyage what
then remain the land be hundred of league away and lock japan
the near -PRON- stand alone here upon an open sea with two ocean and
a whole continent between -PRON- and law aye aye tis so be heaven
a murderer when -PRON- lightning strike a would be murderer in -PRON- bed
tinder sheet and skin together and would -PRON- be a murderer then
if and slowly stealthily and half sideways look -PRON- place the
loaded musket 's end against the door

on this level ahab 's hammock swing within -PRON- head this way a
touch and starbuck may survive to hug -PRON- wife and child again oh
mary mary!--boy boy boy!--but if -PRON- wake thee not to death old man
who can tell to what unsound deep starbuck 's body this day week
may sink with all the crew great god where art thou shall -PRON- shall
-PRON- the wind have go down and shift sir the fore and main topsail
be reefed and set -PRON- head -PRON- course

stern all oh moby dick -PRON- clutch thy heart at last

such be the sound that now come hurtle from out the old man 's
tormented sleep as if starbuck 's voice have cause the long dumb dream
to speak

the yet level musket shake like a drunkard 's arm against the panel
starbuck seem wrestle with an angel but turn from the door -PRON-
place the death tube in -PRON- rack and leave the place

-PRON- be too sound asleep mr. stubb go thou down and wake -PRON- and tell
-PRON- -PRON- must see to the deck here thou know'st what to say



chapter 124 the needle


next morning the not yet subside sea roll in long slow billow of
mighty bulk and strive in the pequod 's gurgle track push -PRON- on
like giant palm outspread the strong unstaggering breeze abound
so that sky and air seem vast outbellying sail the whole world
boom before the wind muffle in the full morning light the invisible
sun be only know by the spread intensity of -PRON- place where -PRON-
bayonet ray move on in stack emblazoning as of crown babylonian
king and queen reign over everything the sea be as a crucible of
molten gold that bubblingly leap with light and heat

long maintain an enchanted silence ahab stand apart and every time
the tetering ship loweringly pitch down -PRON- bowsprit -PRON- turn to eye
the bright sun 's ray produce ahead and when -PRON- profoundly settle by
the stern -PRON- turn behind and see the sun 's rearward place and how
the same yellow ray be blend with -PRON- undeviating wake

ha ha -PRON- ship thou mightest well be take now for the sea chariot of
the sun ho ho all ye nation before -PRON- prow -PRON- br the sun to ye
yoke on the further billow hallo a tandem -PRON- drive the sea

but suddenly rein back by some counter thought -PRON- hurry towards the
helm huskily demand how the ship be head

east sou east sir say the frightened steersman

thou li smite -PRON- with -PRON- clenched fist head east at this
hour in the morning and the sun astern

upon this every soul be confound for the phenomenon just then
observe by ahab have unaccountably escape every one else but -PRON- very
blind palpableness must have be the cause

thrust -PRON- head half way into the binnacle ahab catch one glimpse
of the compass -PRON- uplifted arm slowly fall for a moment -PRON- almost
seem to stagger stand behind -PRON- starbuck look and lo the two
compass point east and the pequod be as infallibly go west

but ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew
the old man with a rigid laugh exclaim -PRON- have -PRON- -PRON- have happen
before mr. starbuck last night 's thunder turn -PRON- compass that be
all thou hast before now hear of such a thing -PRON- take -PRON-

aye but never before have -PRON- happen to -PRON- sir say the pale mate
gloomily

here -PRON- must need be say that accident like this have in more than
one case occur to ship in violent storm the magnetic energy as
develop in the mariner 's needle be as all know essentially one with
the electricity beheld in heaven hence -PRON- be not to be much marvel
at that such thing should be instance where the lightning have
actually strike the vessel so as to smite down some of the spar and
rig the effect upon the needle have at time be still more fatal
all -PRON- loadstone virtue be annihilate so that the before magnetic
steel be of no more use than an old wife 's knitting needle but in
either case the needle never again of -PRON- recover the original
virtue thus mar or lose and if the binnacle compass be affect
the same fate reach all the other that may be in the ship even be
the lowermost one insert into the kelson

deliberately stand before the binnacle and eye the transpoint
compass the old man with the sharp of -PRON- extended hand now take
the precise bearing of the sun and satisfy that the needle be
exactly inverted shout out -PRON- order for the ship 's course to be
change accordingly the yard be hard up and once more the pequod
thrust -PRON- undaunted bow into the oppose wind for the suppose fair
one have only be juggle -PRON-

meanwhile whatev be -PRON- own secret thought starbuck say nothing
but quietly -PRON- issue all requisite order while stubb and flask who
in some small degree seem then to be share -PRON- feeling likewise
unmurmuringly acquiesce as for the man though some of -PRON- lowly
rumble -PRON- fear of ahab be great than -PRON- fear of fate but as
ever before the pagan harpooneer remain almost wholly unimpressed
or if impressed -PRON- be only with a certain magnetism shoot into -PRON-
congenial heart from inflexible ahab 's

for a space the old man walk the deck in roll reverie but
chance to slip with -PRON- ivory heel -PRON- see the crushed copper
sight tube of the quadrant -PRON- have the day before dash to the deck

thou poor proud heaven gazer and sun 's pilot yesterday -PRON- wreck
thee and to day the compass would fain have wreck -PRON- so so but
ahab be lord over the level loadstone yet mr. starbuck a lance without
a pole a top maul and the small of the sail maker 's needle
quick

accessory perhaps to the impulse dictate the thing -PRON- be now about
to do be certain prudential motif whose object may have be to
revive the spirit of -PRON- crew by a stroke of -PRON- subtile skill in a
matter so wondrous as that of the inverted compass besides the old
man well know that to steer by transpoint needle though clumsily
practicable be not a thing to be pass over by superstitious sailor
without some shuddering and evil portent

man say -PRON- steadily turn upon the crew as the mate hand
-PRON- the thing -PRON- have demand -PRON- man the thunder turn old ahab 's
needle but out of this bit of steel ahab can make one of -PRON- own that
will point as true as any

abashed glance of servile wonder be exchange by the sailor as this
be say and with fascinated eye -PRON- await whatev magic may
follow but starbuck look away

with a blow from the top maul ahab knock off the steel head of the
lance and then hand to the mate the long iron rod remain bid
-PRON- hold -PRON- upright without -PRON- touch the deck then with the maul
after repeatedly smite the upper end of this iron rod -PRON- place the
blunt needle endwise on the top of -PRON- and less strongly hammer
that several time the mate still hold the rod as before then
go through some small strange motion with -PRON- whether indispensable
to the magnetizing of the steel or merely intend to augment the awe
of the crew be uncertain -PRON- call for linen thread and move to the
binnacle slip out the two reverse needle there and horizontally
suspend the sail needle by -PRON- middle over one of the compass card
at first the steel go round and round quivering and vibrate at
either end but at last -PRON- settle to -PRON- place when ahab who have
be intently watch for this result step frankly back from the
binnacle and point -PRON- stretched arm towards -PRON- exclaimed,--"look
ye for yourself if ahab be not lord of the level loadstone the sun
be east and that compass swear -PRON-

one after another -PRON- peer in for nothing but -PRON- own eye could
persuade such ignorance as -PRON- and one after another -PRON- slink
away

in -PRON- fiery eye of scorn and triumph -PRON- then see ahab in all -PRON-
fatal pride



chapter 125 the log and line


while now the fat pequod have be so long afloat this voyage the log
and line have but very seldom be in use owe to a confident reliance
upon other mean of determine the vessel 's place some merchantman
and many whaleman especially when cruise wholly neglect to heave the
log though at the same time and frequently more for form 's sake than
anything else regularly put down upon the customary slate the
course steer by the ship as well as the presume average rate of
progression every hour -PRON- have be thus with the pequod the wooden
reel and angular log attach hang long untouched just beneath the
railing of the after bulwark rain and spray have damp -PRON- sun and
wind have warp -PRON- all the element have combine to rot a thing that
hang so idly but heedless of all this -PRON- mood seize ahab as -PRON-
happen to glance upon the reel not many hour after the magnet scene
and -PRON- remember how -PRON- quadrant be no more and recall -PRON- frantic
oath about the level log and line the ship be sail plungingly
astern the billow roll in riot

forward there heave the log

two seaman come the golden hued tahitian and the grizzly manxman take
the reel one of ye -PRON- will heave

-PRON- go towards the extreme stern on the ship 's lee side where the
deck with the oblique energy of the wind be now almost dip into
the creamy sidelong rush sea

the manxman take the reel and hold -PRON- high up by the project
handle end of the spindle round which the spool of line revolve so
stand with the angular log hang downward till ahab advance to -PRON-

ahab stand before -PRON- and be lightly unwind some thirty or forty
turn to form a preliminary hand coil to toss overboard when the old
manxman who be intently eye both -PRON- and the line make bold to
speak

sir -PRON- mistrust -PRON- this line look far go long heat and wet have
spoil -PRON-

twill hold old gentleman long heat and wet have -PRON- spoil thee
thou seem'st to hold or truer perhaps life hold thee not thou -PRON-

-PRON- hold the spool sir but just as -PRON- captain say with these
grey hair of mine tis not worth while dispute specially with a
superior who will ne'er confess

what be that there now be a patch professor in queen nature 's
granite found college but methink -PRON- be too subservient where wert
thou bear

in the little rocky isle of man sir

excellent thou'st hit the world by that

-PRON- know not sir but -PRON- be bear there

in the isle of man hey well the other way -PRON- be good here be a man
from man a man bear in once independent man and now unmanned of man
which be suck in by what up with the reel the dead blind wall
butts all inquire head at last up with -PRON- so

the log be heave the loose coil rapidly straighten out in a long
drag line astern and then instantly the reel begin to whirl in
turn jerkingly raise and lower by the rolling billow the towing
resistance of the log cause the old reelman to stagger strangely

hold hard

snap the overstrained line sag down in one long festoon the tug
log be go

-PRON- crush the quadrant the thunder turn the needle and now the mad
sea part the log line but ahab can mend all haul in here tahitian
reel up manxman and look ye let the carpenter make another log and
mend thou the line see to -PRON-

there -PRON- go now to -PRON- nothing 's happen but to -PRON- the skewer
seem loosen out of the middle of the world haul in haul in
tahitian these line run whole and whirl out come in broken and
drag slow ha pip come to help eh pip

pip whom call ye pip pip jump from the whale boat pip 's missing
let 's see now if ye haven't fish -PRON- up here fisherman -PRON- drag
hard -PRON- gues -PRON- be hold on jerk -PRON- tahiti jerk -PRON- off -PRON- haul
in no coward here ho there be -PRON- arm just break water a hatchet
a hatchet cut -PRON- off -PRON- haul in no coward here captain ahab sir
sir here be pip try to get on board again

peace thou crazy loon cry the manxman seize -PRON- by the arm
away from the quarter deck

the great idiot ever scold the less mutter ahab advance
hand off from that holiness where say thou pip be boy

astern there sir astern lo lo

and who art thou boy -PRON- see not -PRON- reflection in the vacant pupil of
thy eye oh god that man should be a thing for immortal soul to sieve
through who art thou boy

bell boy sir ship's crier d dong d pip pip pip
one hundred pound of clay reward for pip five foot high look
cowardly quickest know by that ding dong ding who be see pip the
coward

there can be no heart above the snow line oh ye frozen heaven look
down here ye do beget this luckless child and have abandon -PRON-
ye creative libertine here boy ahab 's cabin shall be pip 's home
henceforth while ahab live thou touch -PRON- inmost centre boy thou
art tie to -PRON- by cord weave of -PRON- heart string come let 's down

what be this here be velvet shark skin intently gaze at ahab 's hand
and feel -PRON- ah now have poor pip but feel so kind a thing as this
perhaps -PRON- have ne'er be lose this seem to -PRON- sir as a man rope
something that weak soul may hold by oh sir let old perth now come
and rivet these two hand together the black one with the white for -PRON-
will not let this go

oh boy nor will -PRON- thee unless -PRON- should thereby drag thee to bad
horror than be here come then to -PRON- cabin lo ye believer in
god all goodness and in man all ill lo -PRON- see the omniscient god
oblivious of suffer man and man though idiotic and know not
what -PRON- do yet full of the sweet thing of love and gratitude come
-PRON- feel prouder lead thee by thy black hand than though -PRON- grasp an
emperor 's

there go two daft one now mutter the old manxman one daft with
strength the other daft with weakness but here be the end of the rotten
line all drip too mend -PRON- eh -PRON- think -PRON- have good have a new
line altogether -PRON- will see mr. stubb about -PRON-



chapter 126 the life buoy


steering now south eastward by ahab 's level steel and -PRON- progress
solely determine by ahab 's level log and line the pequod hold on
-PRON- path towards the equator make so long a passage through such
unfrequented water descry no ship and ere long sideways impel
by unvary trade wind over wave monotonously mild all these seem
the strange calm thing prelude some riotous and desperate scene

at last when the ship draw near to the outskirt as -PRON- be of the
equatorial fishing ground and in the deep darkness that go before the
dawn be sail by a cluster of rocky islet the watch then head
by flask be startle by a cry so plaintively wild and unearthly like
half articulate wailing of the ghost of all herod 's murder
innocent that one and all -PRON- start from -PRON- reverie and for
the space of some moment stand or sit or lean all transfixedly
listen like the carved roman slave while that wild cry remain
within hearing the christian or civilized part of the crew say -PRON- be
mermaid and shudder but the pagan harpooneer remain unappalled
yet the grey manxman the old mariner of all declare that the wild
thrilling sound that be hear be the voice of newly drown man
in the sea

below in -PRON- hammock ahab do not hear of this till grey dawn when
-PRON- come to the deck -PRON- be then recount to -PRON- by flask not
unaccompani with hint dark meaning -PRON- hollowly laugh and thus
explain the wonder

those rocky island the ship have pass be the resort of great number
of seal and some young seal that have lose -PRON- dam or some dam
that have lose -PRON- cub must have rise nigh the ship and keep company
with -PRON- cry and sob with -PRON- human sort of wail but this
only the more affect some of -PRON- because most mariner cherish a
very superstitious feeling about seal arise not only from -PRON-
peculiar tone when in distress but also from the human look of -PRON-
round head and semi intelligent face see peeringly uprising from
the water alongside in the sea under certain circumstance seal have
more than once be mistaken for man

but the boding of the crew be destine to receive a most plausible
confirmation in the fate of one of -PRON- number that morning at
sun rise this man go from -PRON- hammock to -PRON- mast head at the fore
and whether -PRON- be that -PRON- be not yet half wake from -PRON- sleep for
sailor sometimes go aloft in a transition state whether -PRON- be thus
with the man there be now no tell but be that as -PRON- may -PRON-
have not be long at -PRON- perch when a cry be hear a cry and a
rush and look up -PRON- see a fall phantom in the air and
look down a little toss heap of white bubble in the blue of the
sea

the life buoy a long slender cask be drop from the stern where -PRON-
always hang obedient to a cunning spring but no hand rise to seize -PRON-
and the sun have long beat upon this cask -PRON- have shrink so that -PRON-
slowly fill and that parched wood also fill at -PRON- every pore and
the studded iron bind cask follow the sailor to the bottom as if to
yield -PRON- -PRON- pillow though in sooth but a hard one

and thus the first man of the pequod that mount the mast to look out
for the white whale on the white whale 's own peculiar ground that man
be swallow up in the deep but few perhaps thought of that at the
time indeed in some sort -PRON- be not grieve at this event at
least as a portent for -PRON- regard -PRON- not as a foreshadowing of evil
in the future but as the fulfilment of an evil already presage -PRON-
declare that now -PRON- know the reason of those wild shriek -PRON- have
hear the night before but again the old manxman say nay

the lost life buoy be now to be replace starbuck be direct to see
to -PRON- but as no cask of sufficient lightness could be find and as
in the feverish eagerness of what seem the approach crisis of
the voyage all hand be impatient of any toil but what be directly
connect with -PRON- final end whatev that may prove to be
therefore -PRON- be go to leave the ship 's stern unprovided with a
buoy when by certain strange sign and inuendoe queequeg hint a hint
concern -PRON- coffin

a life buoy of a coffin cry starbuck start

rather queer that -PRON- should say say stubb

-PRON- will make a good enough one say flask the carpenter here can
arrange -PRON- easily

bring -PRON- up there be nothing else for -PRON- say starbuck after a
melancholy pause rig -PRON- carpenter do not look at -PRON- so the coffin
-PRON- mean dost thou hear -PRON- rig -PRON-

and shall -PRON- nail down the lid sir move -PRON- hand as with a hammer

aye

and shall -PRON- caulk the seam sir move -PRON- hand as with a
caulking iron

aye

and shall -PRON- then pay over the same with pitch sir move -PRON- hand as
with a pitch pot

away what possess thee to this make a life buoy of the coffin and
no more mr stubb mr. flask come forward with -PRON-

-PRON- go off in a huff the whole -PRON- can endure at the part -PRON- baulk
now -PRON- do not like this -PRON- make a leg for captain ahab and -PRON- wear -PRON-
like a gentleman but -PRON- make a bandbox for queequeg and -PRON- will not put
-PRON- head into -PRON- be all -PRON- pain to go for nothing with that coffin
and now -PRON- be order to make a life buoy of -PRON- -PRON- be like turn an old
coat go to bring the flesh on the other side now -PRON- do not like this
cobble sort of business -PRON- do not like -PRON- at all -PRON- 's undignified
-PRON- be not -PRON- place let tinker brat do tinkering -PRON- be -PRON-
better -PRON- like to take in hand none but clean virgin fair and square
mathematical job something that regularly begin at the beginning and
be at the middle when midway and come to an end at the conclusion not
a cobbler 's job that be at an end in the middle and at the beginning at
the end -PRON- be the old woman 's trick to be give cobble job lord
what an affection all old woman have for tinker -PRON- know an old woman of
sixty five who run away with a bald head young tinker once and that be
the reason -PRON- never would work for lonely widow old woman ashore when
-PRON- keep -PRON- job shop in the vineyard -PRON- may have take -PRON- into -PRON-
lonely old head to run off with -PRON- but heigh ho there be no cap at
sea but snow cap let -PRON- see nail down the lid caulk the seam pay
over the same with pitch batten -PRON- down tight and hang -PRON- with the
snap spring over the ship 's stern be ever such thing do before
with a coffin some superstitious old carpenter now would be tie
up in the rigging ere -PRON- would do the job but -PRON- be make of knotty
aroostook hemlock -PRON- do not budge crupper with a coffin sail
about with a grave yard tray but never mind -PRON- worker in wood make
bridal bedstead and card table as well as coffin and hearse -PRON-
work by the month or by the job or by the profit not for -PRON- to ask
the why and wherefore of -PRON- work unless -PRON- be too confounded cobbling
and then -PRON- stash -PRON- if -PRON- can hem -PRON- will do the job now tenderly
-PRON- will have -PRON- let 's see how many in the ship 's company all tell but
-PRON- have forget any way -PRON- will have -PRON- thirty separate turk's head
life line each three foot long hang all round to the coffin then
if the hull go down there will be thirty lively fellow all fight for
one coffin a sight not see very often beneath the sun come hammer
caulking iron pitch pot and marling spike let 's to -PRON-



chapter 127 the deck


the coffin lay upon two line tubs between the vice bench and the open
hatchway the carpenter caulking its seams the string of twisted oakum
slowly unwinding from a large roll of it place in the bosom of
his frock ahab comes slowly from the cabin gangway and hears pip
follow him


back lad -PRON- will be with ye again presently -PRON- go not this hand
complie with -PRON- humor more genially than that boy middle aisle of a
church what be here

life buoy sir mr. starbuck 's order oh look sir beware the
hatchway

thank ye man thy coffin lie handy to the vault

sir the hatchway oh so -PRON- do sir so -PRON- do

art not thou the leg maker look do not this stump come from thy
shop

-PRON- believe -PRON- do sir do the ferrule stand sir

well enough but art thou not also the undertaker

aye sir -PRON- patch up this thing here as a coffin for queequeg but
-PRON- have set -PRON- now to turn -PRON- into something else

then tell -PRON- art thou not an arrant all grasp intermeddl
monopolising heathenish old scamp to be one day make leg and the
next day coffin to clap -PRON- in and yet again life buoy out of those
same coffin thou art as unprincipled as the god and as much of a
jack of all trade

but -PRON- do not mean anything sir -PRON- do as -PRON- do

the god again hark ye dost thou not ever sing work about a
coffin the titans -PRON- say hummed snatch when chip out the
crater for volcano and the grave digger in the play sing spade in
hand dost thou never

sing sir do -PRON- sing oh -PRON- be indifferent enough sir for that but
the reason why the grave digger make music must have be because there
be none in -PRON- spade sir but the caulking mallet be full of -PRON- hark
to -PRON-

aye and that be because the lid there be a sounding board and what in
all thing make the sounding board be this there be naught beneath and
yet a coffin with a body in -PRON- ring pretty much the same carpenter
hast thou ever help carry a bier and hear the coffin knock against
the churchyard gate go in

faith sir i've--

faith what be that

why faith sir -PRON- be only a sort of exclamation like that be all
sir

um um go on

-PRON- be about to say sir that--

art thou a silk worm dost thou spin thy own shroud out of thyself
look at thy bosom despatch and get these trap out of sight

-PRON- go aft that be sudden now but squall come sudden in hot
latitude -PRON- have hear that the isle of albemarle one of the gallipagos
be cut by the equator right in the middle seem to -PRON- some sort of
equator cut yon old man too right in -PRON- middle -PRON- be always under
the line fiery hot -PRON- tell ye -PRON- be look this way come oakum
quick here -PRON- go again this wooden mallet be the cork and -PRON- be the
professor of musical glass tap tap

the hollow tree blind and dumb may well be envy now see that
thing rest on two line tub full of tow line a most malicious wag
that fellow rat tat so man 's second tick oh how immaterial be all
material what thing real be there but imponderable thought here
now be the very dreaded symbol of grim death by a mere hap make
the expressive sign of the help and hope of most endanger life
a life buoy of a coffin do -PRON- go further can -PRON- be that in some
spiritual sense the coffin be after all but an immortality preserver
-PRON- will think of that but no so far go be -PRON- in the dark side of earth
that -PRON- other side the theoretic bright one seem but uncertain
twilight to -PRON- will ye never have do carpenter with that accurse
sound -PRON- go below let -PRON- not see that thing here when -PRON- return
again now then pip -PRON- will talk this over -PRON- do suck most wondrous
philosophy from thee some unknown conduit from the unknown world
must empty into thee



chapter 128 the pequod meets the rachel


next day a large ship the rachel be descry bear directly down
upon the pequod all -PRON- spar thickly cluster with man at the
time the pequod be make good speed through the water but as the
broad winged windward stranger shoot nigh to -PRON- the boastful sail all
fall together as blank bladder that be burst and all life flee from
the smitten hull

bad news -PRON- bring bad news mutter the old manxman but ere -PRON-
commander who with trumpet to mouth stand up in -PRON- boat ere -PRON-
could hopefully hail ahab 's voice be hear

hast see the white whale

aye yesterday have ye see a whale boat adrift

throttle -PRON- joy ahab negatively answer this unexpected question
and would then have fain board the stranger when the stranger captain
-PRON- have stop -PRON- vessel 's way be see descend -PRON-
side a few keen pull and -PRON- boat hook soon clinch the pequod 's
main chain and -PRON- spring to the deck immediately -PRON- be recognise by
ahab for a nantucketer -PRON- know but no formal salutation be exchange

where be -PRON- not killed!--not kill cry ahab closely advance
how be -PRON-

-PRON- seem that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previous while
three of the stranger 's boat be engage with a shoal of whale which
have lead -PRON- some four or five mile from the ship and while -PRON- be
yet in swift chase to windward the white hump and head of moby dick have
suddenly loom up out of the water not very far to leeward whereupon
the fourth rigged boat a reserved one have be instantly lower in
chase after a keen sail before the wind this fourth boat the swift
keel of all seem to have succeed in fastening at least as
well as the man at the mast head could tell anything about -PRON- in the
distance -PRON- see the diminished dotted boat and then a swift gleam
of bubble white water and after that nothing more whence -PRON- be
conclude that the stricken whale must have indefinitely run away with
-PRON- pursuer as often happen there be some apprehension but no
positive alarm as yet the recall signal be place in the rigging
darkness come on and force to pick up -PRON- three far to windward
boat ere go in quest of the fourth one in the precisely opposite
direction the ship have not only be necessitate to leave that boat to
-PRON- fate till near midnight but for the time to increase -PRON- distance
from -PRON- but the rest of -PRON- crew be at last safe aboard -PRON- crowd
all sail stunsail on stunsail after the missing boat kindle a fire
in -PRON- try pot for a beacon and every other man aloft on the look out
but though when -PRON- have thus sail a sufficient distance to gain the
presumed place of the absent one when last see though -PRON- then
pause to lower -PRON- spare boat to pull all around -PRON- and not find
anything have again dash on again pause and lower -PRON- boat and
though -PRON- have thus continue do till daylight yet not the least
glimpse of the miss keel have be see

the story tell the stranger captain immediately go on to reveal -PRON-
object in board the pequod -PRON- desire that ship to unite with -PRON-
own in the search by sail over the sea some four or five mile
apart on parallel line and so sweep a double horizon as -PRON- be

-PRON- will wager something now whisper stubb to flask that some one
in that miss boat wear off that captain 's good coat mayhap -PRON-
watch -PRON- be so cursed anxious to get -PRON- back who ever hear of two
pious whale ship cruise after one miss whale boat in the height of
the whaling season see flask only see how pale -PRON- look pale in the
very button of -PRON- eye look -PRON- be not the coat -PRON- must have be
the--

-PRON- boy -PRON- own boy be among -PRON- for god 's sake -PRON- beg -PRON-
conjure here exclaim the stranger captain to ahab who thus far
have but icily receive -PRON- petition for eight and forty hour let -PRON-
charter -PRON- ship -PRON- will gladly pay for -PRON- and roundly pay for -PRON- if
there be no other way for eight and forty hour only only that -PRON-
must oh -PRON- must and -PRON- shall do this thing

-PRON- son cry stubb oh -PRON- be -PRON- son -PRON- be lose -PRON- take back the
coat and watch what say ahab -PRON- must save that boy

-PRON- be drown with the rest on 'em last night say the old manx
sailor stand behind -PRON- -PRON- hear all of ye hear -PRON- spirit

now as -PRON- shortly turn out what make this incident of the rachel 's
the more melancholy be the circumstance that not only be one of the
captain 's son among the number of the miss boat 's crew but among
the number of the other boat 's crew at the same time but on the other
hand separate from the ship during the dark vicissitude of the chase
there have be still another son as that for a time the wretched
father be plunge to the bottom of the cruell perplexity which
be only solve for -PRON- by -PRON- chief mate 's instinctively adopt the
ordinary procedure of a whale ship in such emergency that is when
place between jeopardized but divide boat always to pick up the
majority first but the captain for some unknown constitutional reason
have refrain from mention all this and not till force to -PRON- by
ahab 's iciness do -PRON- allude to -PRON- one yet miss boy a little lad
but twelve year old whose father with the earnest but unmisgiving
hardihood of a nantucketer 's paternal love have thus early seek to
initiate -PRON- in the peril and wonder of a vocation almost immemorially
the destiny of all -PRON- race nor do -PRON- unfrequently occur that
nantucket captain will send a son of such tender age away from -PRON-
for a protracted three or four year voyage in some other ship than
-PRON- own so that -PRON- first knowledge of a whaleman 's career shall
be unenervat by any chance display of a father 's natural but untimely
partiality or undue apprehensiveness and concern

meantime now the stranger be still beseech -PRON- poor boon of ahab
and ahab still stand like an anvil receive every shock but without
the least quivering of -PRON- own

-PRON- will not go say the stranger till -PRON- say aye to -PRON- do to -PRON-
as -PRON- would have -PRON- do to -PRON- in the like case for you too have a boy
captain ahab though but a child and nestle safely at home now a
child of -PRON- old age too yes yes -PRON- relent -PRON- see -PRON- run run
man now and stand by to square in the yard

avast cry ahab--"touch not a rope yarn then in a voice that
prolongingly mould every word--"captain gardiner -PRON- will not do -PRON-
even now -PRON- lose time good bye good bye god bles ye man and may -PRON-
forgive -PRON- but -PRON- must go mr. starbuck look at the binnacle watch
and in three minute from this present instant warn off all stranger
then brace forward again and let the ship sail as before

hurriedly turn with avert face -PRON- descend into -PRON- cabin
leave the strange captain transfix at this unconditional and utter
rejection of -PRON- so earnest suit but start from -PRON- enchantment
gardiner silently hurry to the side more fall than step into -PRON-
boat and return to -PRON- ship

soon the two ship diverge -PRON- wake and long as the strange vessel
be in view -PRON- be see to yaw hither and thither at every dark spot
however small on the sea this way and that -PRON- yard be swung round
starboard and larboard -PRON- continue to tack now -PRON- beat against a
head sea and again -PRON- push -PRON- before -PRON- while all the while -PRON-
mast and yard be thickly cluster with man as three tall cherry
tree when the boy be cherry among the bough

but by -PRON- still halt course and wind woeful way -PRON- plainly see
that this ship that so weep with spray still remain without comfort
-PRON- be rachel weep for -PRON- child because -PRON- be not



chapter 129 the cabin


ahab moving to go on deck pip catches him by the hand to follow

lad lad -PRON- tell thee thou must not follow ahab now the hour be come

chapter 130 the hat


and now that at the proper time and place after so long and wide a
preliminary cruise ahab all other whaling water sweep seem to
have chase -PRON- foe into an ocean fold to slay -PRON- the more securely
there now that -PRON- find -PRON- hard by the very latitude and
longitude where -PRON- tormenting wound have be inflict now that a
vessel have be speak which on the very day precede have actually
encounter moby dick and now that all -PRON- successive meeting with
various ship contrastingly concur to show the demoniac indifference
with which the white whale tear -PRON- hunter whether sin or sin
against now -PRON- be that there lurk a something in the old man 's eye
which -PRON- be hardly sufferable for feeble soul to see as the unsetting
polar star which through the livelong arctic six month night
sustain -PRON- piercing steady central gaze so ahab 's purpose now
fixedly gleam down upon the constant midnight of the gloomy crew -PRON-
domineer above -PRON- so that all -PRON- boding doubt misgiving
fear be fain to hide beneath -PRON- soul and not sprout forth a
single spear or leaf

in this foreshadowing interval too all humor force or natural
vanish stubb no more strove to raise a smile starbuck no more strove
to check one alike joy and sorrow hope and fear seem ground to
fine dust and powder for the time in the clamp mortar of
ahab 's iron soul like machine -PRON- dumbly move about the deck ever
conscious that the old man 's despot eye be on -PRON-

but do -PRON- deeply scan -PRON- in -PRON- more secret confidential hour when
-PRON- think no glance but one be on -PRON- then -PRON- would have see that
even as ahab 's eye so awe the crew 's the inscrutable parsee 's glance
awe -PRON- or somehow at least in some wild way at time affect -PRON-
such an add glide strangeness begin to invest the thin fedallah
now such ceaseless shuddering shake -PRON- that the man look dubious
at -PRON- half uncertain as -PRON- seem whether indeed -PRON- be a mortal
substance or else a tremulous shadow cast upon the deck by some unseen
be 's body and that shadow be always hover there for not by
night even have fedallah ever certainly be know to slumber or go
below -PRON- would stand still for hour but never sit or lean -PRON- wan
but wondrous eye do plainly say -PRON- two watchman never rest

nor at any time by night or day could the mariner now step upon the
deck unless ahab be before -PRON- either stand in -PRON- pivot hole or
exactly pace the plank between two undeviat limit the main mast
and the mizen or else -PRON- see -PRON- stand in the cabin scuttle -PRON-
live foot advanced upon the deck as if to step -PRON- hat slouch
heavily over -PRON- eye so that however motionless -PRON- stand however the
day and night be add on that -PRON- have not swing in -PRON- hammock
yet hide beneath that slouch hat -PRON- could never tell unerringly
whether for all this -PRON- eye be really close at time or whether
-PRON- be still intently scan -PRON- no matter though -PRON- stand so in
the scuttle for a whole hour on the stretch and the unheeded night damp
gather in bead of dew upon that stone carve coat and hat the
clothe that the night have wet the next day 's sunshine dry upon -PRON-
and so day after day and night after night -PRON- go no more beneath
the plank whatev -PRON- want from the cabin that thing -PRON- send for

-PRON- eat in the same open air that is -PRON- two only meal breakfast and
dinner supper -PRON- never touch nor reap -PRON- beard which darkly grow
all gnarled as unearthed root of tree blow over which still grow
idly on at naked base though perish in the upper verdure but though
-PRON- whole life be now become one watch on deck and though the parsee 's
mystic watch be without intermission as -PRON- own yet these two never
seem to speak one man to the other unless at long interval some
pass unmomentous matter make -PRON- necessary though such a potent spell
seem secretly to join the twain openly and to the awe strike crew
-PRON- seem pole like asunder if by day -PRON- chance to speak one word
by night dumb man be both so far as concern the slight verbal
interchange at time for long hour without a single hail -PRON-
stand far part in the starlight ahab in -PRON- scuttle the parsee by
the mainmast but still fixedly gaze upon each other as if in the
parsee ahab see -PRON- forethrown shadow in ahab the parsee -PRON- abandon
substance

and yet somehow do ahab in -PRON- own proper self as daily hourly
and every instant commandingly reveal to -PRON- subordinate ahab
seem an independent lord the parsee but -PRON- slave still again both
seem yoke together and an unseen tyrant drive -PRON- the lean shade
side the solid rib for be this parsee what -PRON- may all rib and keel
be solid ahab

at the first faintest glimmering of the dawn -PRON- iron voice be hear
from aft,--"man the mast heads!"--and all through the day till after
sunset and after twilight the same voice every hour at the striking of
the helmsman 's bell be heard--"what d'ye see sharp sharp

but when three or four day have slide by after meet the
child seek rachel and no spout have yet be see the monomaniac
old man seem distrustful of -PRON- crew 's fidelity at least of nearly
all except the pagan harpooneer -PRON- seem to doubt even whether
stubb and flask may not willingly overlook the sight -PRON- seek but if
these suspicion be really -PRON- -PRON- sagaciously refrain from verbally
express -PRON- however -PRON- action may seem to hint -PRON-

-PRON- will have the first sight of the whale -PRON- -PRON- say aye
ahab must have the doubloon and with -PRON- own hand -PRON- rig a nest
of basket bowline and send a hand aloft with a single sheaved
block to secure to the main mast head -PRON- receive the two end of the
downward reeve rope and attach one to -PRON- basket prepare a pin for
the other end in order to fasten -PRON- at the rail this do with that
end yet in -PRON- hand and standing beside the pin -PRON- look round upon
-PRON- crew sweep from one to the other pause -PRON- glance long upon
daggoo queequeg tashtego but shun fedallah and then settle -PRON-
firm rely eye upon the chief mate said,--"take the rope sir -PRON- give
-PRON- into thy hand starbuck then arrange -PRON- person in the basket
-PRON- give the word for -PRON- to hoist -PRON- to -PRON- perch starbuck be
the one who secure the rope at last and afterwards stand near -PRON- and
thus with one hand cling round the royal mast ahab gaze abroad
upon the sea for mile and mile ahead astern this side and
that within the wide expanded circle command at so great a height

when in work with -PRON- hand at some lofty almost isolated place in
the rigging which chance to afford no foothold the sailor at sea be
hoist up to that spot and sustain there by the rope under these
circumstance -PRON- fastened end on deck be always give in strict charge
to some one man who have the special watch of -PRON- because in such a
wilderness of run rigging whose various different relation aloft
can not always be infallibly discern by what be see of -PRON- at the
deck and when the deck end of these rope be be every few minute
cast down from the fastening -PRON- would be but a natural fatality if
unprovided with a constant watchman the hoist sailor should by some
carelessness of the crew be cast adrift and fall all swoop to the
sea so ahab 's proceeding in this matter be not unusual the only
strange thing about -PRON- seem to be that starbuck almost the one
only man who have ever venture to oppose -PRON- with anything in the
slight degree approach to decision one of those too whose
faithfulness on the look out -PRON- have seem to doubt somewhat -PRON- be
strange that this be the very man -PRON- should select for -PRON- watchman
freely give -PRON- whole life into such an otherwise distrust person 's
hand

now the first time ahab be perch aloft ere -PRON- have be there ten
minute one of those red bill savage sea hawk which so often fly
incommodiously close round the manned mast head of whaleman in these
latitude one of these bird come wheeling and screaming round -PRON- head
in a maze of untrackably swift circling then -PRON- dart a thousand foot
straight up into the air then spiraliz downward and go eddy
again round -PRON- head

but with -PRON- gaze fix upon the dim and distant horizon ahab seem
not to mark this wild bird nor indeed would any one else have mark
-PRON- much -PRON- be no uncommon circumstance only now almost the least
heedful eye seem to see some sort of cunning meaning in almost every
sight

-PRON- hat -PRON- hat sir suddenly cry the sicilian seaman who
be post at the mizen mast head stand directly behind ahab though
somewhat low than -PRON- level and with a deep gulf of air divide
-PRON-

but already the sable wing be before the old man 's eye the long
hook bill at -PRON- head with a scream the black hawk dart away with
-PRON- prize

an eagle fly thrice round tarquin 's head remove -PRON- cap to replace
-PRON- and thereupon tanaquil -PRON- wife declare that tarquin would
be king of rome but only by the replacing of the cap be that omen
account good ahab 's hat be never restore the wild hawk fly on and
on with -PRON- far in advance of the prow and at last disappear while
from the point of that disappearance a minute black spot be dimly
discern fall from that vast height into the sea



chapter 131 the pequod meets the delight


the intense pequod sail on the roll wave and day go by the
life buoy coffin still lightly swung and another ship most miserably
misname the delight be descry as -PRON- draw nigh all eye be
fix upon -PRON- broad beam call shear which in some whaling ship
cross the quarter deck at the height of eight or nine foot serve to
carry the spare unrig or disabled boat

upon the stranger 's shear be behold the shattered white rib and
some few splintered plank of what have once be a whale boat but -PRON-
now see through this wreck as plainly as -PRON- see through the peel
half unhinge and bleach skeleton of a horse

hast see the white whale

look reply the hollow cheeked captain from -PRON- taffrail and with
-PRON- trumpet -PRON- point to the wreck

hast kill -PRON-

the harpoon be not yet forge that ever will do that answer the
other sadly glance upon a rounded hammock on the deck whose gather
side some noiseless sailor be busy in sewing together

not forge and snatch perth 's level iron from the crotch ahab
hold -PRON- out exclaiming--"look ye nantucketer here in this hand -PRON- hold
-PRON- death temper in blood and temper by lightning be these barb
and -PRON- swear to temper -PRON- triply in that hot place behind the fin
where the white whale most feel -PRON- accursed life

then god keep thee old man see'st thou that point to the
hammock--"i bury but one of five stout man who be alive only
yesterday but be dead ere night only that one -PRON- bury the rest be
bury before -PRON- die -PRON- sail upon -PRON- tomb then turn to -PRON-
crew--"are ye ready there place the plank then on the rail and
lift the body so then oh god advance towards the hammock with
uplift hands--"may the resurrection and the life--

brace forward up helm cry ahab like lightning to -PRON- man

but the suddenly start pequod be not quick enough to escape the sound
of the splash that the corpse soon make as -PRON- strike the sea not so
quick indeed but that some of the fly bubble may have sprinkle
-PRON- hull with -PRON- ghostly baptism

as ahab now glide from the dejected delight the strange life buoy
hang at the pequod 's stern come into conspicuous relief

ha yonder look yonder man cry a foreboding voice in -PRON- wake
in vain oh ye stranger ye fly -PRON- sad burial ye but turn -PRON- -PRON-
taffrail to show -PRON- -PRON- coffin



chapter 132 the symphony


-PRON- be a clear steel blue day the firmament of air and sea be
hardly separable in that all pervade azure only the pensive air be
transparently pure and soft with a woman 's look and the robust and
man like sea heave with long strong linger swell as samson 's
chest in -PRON- sleep

hither and thither on high glide the snow white wing of small
unspeckled bird these be the gentle thought of the feminine air
but to and fro in the deep far down in the bottomless blue rush
mighty leviathan sword fish and shark and these be the strong
troubled murderous thinking of the masculine sea

but though thus contrast within the contrast be only in shade and
shadow without those two seem one -PRON- be only the sex as -PRON- be
that distinguish -PRON-

aloft like a royal czar and king the sun seem give this gentle
air to this bold and rolling sea even as bride to groom and at the
girdle line of the horizon a soft and tremulous motion most see
here at the equator denote the fond throbbing trust the love
alarm with which the poor bride give -PRON- bosom away

tie up and twist gnarled and knot with wrinkle haggardly firm
and unyielding -PRON- eye glow like coal that still glow in the
ash of ruin untotter ahab stand forth in the clearness of the
morn lift -PRON- splintered helmet of a brow to the fair girl 's
forehead of heaven

oh immortal infancy and innocency of the azure invisible winged
creature that frolic all round -PRON- sweet childhood of air and sky how
oblivious be ye of old ahab 's close coil woe but so have -PRON- see
little miriam and martha laugh eyed elf heedlessly gambol around
-PRON- old sire sport with the circle of singed lock which grow on
the marge of that burn out crater of -PRON- brain

slowly cross the deck from the scuttle ahab lean over the side and
watch how -PRON- shadow in the water sank and sink to -PRON- gaze the more
and the more that -PRON- strive to pierce the profundity but the lovely
aroma in that enchanted air do at last seem to dispel for a moment
the cankerous thing in -PRON- soul that glad happy air that winsome
sky do at last stroke and caress -PRON- the step mother world so long
cruel forbid now threw affectionate arm round -PRON- stubborn neck
and do seem to joyously sob over -PRON- as if over one that however
wilful and err -PRON- could yet find -PRON- in -PRON- heart to save and to
bless from beneath -PRON- slouch hat ahab drop a tear into the sea
nor do all the pacific contain such wealth as that one wee drop

starbuck see the old man see -PRON- how -PRON- heavily lean over the side
and -PRON- seem to hear in -PRON- own true heart the measureless sob that
steal out of the centre of the serenity around careful not to touch
-PRON- or be notice by -PRON- -PRON- yet draw near to -PRON- and stand there

ahab turn

ahab cross the deck to gaze over on the other side but start at
two reflect fix eye in the water there fedallah be motionlessly
lean over the same rail



chapter 133 the chase first day


that night in the mid watch when the old man as -PRON- will not at
interval step forth from the scuttle in which -PRON- lean and go
to -PRON- pivot hole -PRON- suddenly thrust out -PRON- face fiercely snuff
up the sea air as a sagacious ship 's dog will in draw nigh to
some barbarous isle -PRON- declare that a whale must be near soon that
peculiar odor sometimes to a great distance give forth by the
live sperm whale be palpable to all the watch nor be any mariner
surprised when after inspect the compass and then the dog vane and
then ascertain the precise bearing of the odor as nearly as possible
ahab rapidly order the ship 's course to be slightly alter and the
sail to be shorten

the acute policy dictate these movement be sufficiently vindicate
at daybreak by the sight of a long sleek on the sea directly and
lengthwise ahead smooth as oil and resemble in the pleated watery
wrinkle border -PRON- the polished metallic like mark of some swift
tide rip at the mouth of a deep rapid stream

man the mast head call all hand

thunder with the butts of three club handspike on the forecastle
deck daggoo rouse the sleeper with such judgment clap that -PRON-
seem to exhale from the scuttle so instantaneously do -PRON- appear
with -PRON- clothe in -PRON- hand

what d'ye see cry ahab flatten -PRON- face to the sky

nothing nothing sir be the sound hail down in reply

t'gallant sails!--stunsail alow and aloft and on both side

all sail be set -PRON- now cast loose the life line reserve for
sway -PRON- to the main royal mast head and in a few moment -PRON- be
hoist -PRON- thither when while but two third of the way aloft
and while peer ahead through the horizontal vacancy between the
main top sail and top gallant sail -PRON- raise a gull like cry in the
air there -PRON- blows!--there -PRON- blow a hump like a snow hill -PRON- be
moby dick

fire by the cry which seem simultaneously take up by the three
look out the man on deck rush to the rigging to behold the famous
whale -PRON- have so long be pursue ahab have now gain -PRON- final
perch some foot above the other look out tashtego stand just
beneath -PRON- on the cap of the top gallant mast so that the indian 's
head be almost on a level with ahab 's heel from this height the whale
be now see some mile or so ahead at every roll of the sea reveal
-PRON- high sparkling hump and regularly jet -PRON- silent spout into the
air to the credulous mariner -PRON- seem the same silent spout -PRON- have
so long ago beheld in the moonlit atlantic and indian oceans

and do none of ye see -PRON- before cry ahab hail the perch man
all around -PRON-

-PRON- see -PRON- almost that same instant sir that captain ahab do and -PRON-
cry out say tashtego

not the same instant not the same no the doubloon be mine fate
reserve the doubloon for -PRON- -PRON- only none of ye could have raise the
white whale first there -PRON- blows!--there -PRON- blows!--there -PRON- blow
there again!--there again -PRON- cry in long draw linger methodic
tone attuned to the gradual prolonging of the whale 's visible jet
-PRON- be go to sound in stunsail down top gallant sail stand by
three boat mr. starbuck remember stay on board and keep the ship
helm there luff luff a point so steady man steady there go
fluke no no only black water all ready the boat there stand by
stand by lower -PRON- mr. starbuck low low quick quick and -PRON-
slide through the air to the deck

-PRON- be head straight to leeward sir cry stubb right away from
-PRON- can not have see the ship yet

be dumb man stand by the brace hard down the helm!--brace up
shiver her!--shiver her!--so well that boat boat

soon all the boat but starbuck 's be drop all the boat sail
set all the paddle ply with ripple swiftness shoot to
leeward and ahab head the onset a pale death glimmer light up
fedallah 's sunken eye a hideous motion gnaw -PRON- mouth

like noiseless nautilus shell -PRON- light prow speed through the sea
but only slowly -PRON- near the foe as -PRON- near -PRON- the ocean grow
still more smooth seem draw a carpet over -PRON- wave seem a
noon meadow so serenely -PRON- spread at length the breathless hunter come
so nigh -PRON- seemingly unsuspecting prey that -PRON- entire dazzling hump
be distinctly visible slide along the sea as if an isolated thing
and continually set in a revolving ring of fine fleecy greenish
foam -PRON- see the vast involved wrinkle of the slightly project head
beyond before -PRON- far out on the soft turkish rugged water go
the glisten white shadow from -PRON- broad milky forehead a musical
ripple playfully accompany the shade and behind the blue water
interchangeably flow over into the move valley of -PRON- steady wake
and on either hand bright bubble arise and dance by -PRON- side but
these be break again by the light toe of hundred of gay fowl softly
feather the sea alternate with -PRON- fitful flight and like to
some flag staff rise from the paint hull of an argosy the tall but
shatter pole of a recent lance project from the white whale 's back
and at interval one of the cloud of soft toed fowl hover and
to and fro skimming like a canopy over the fish silently perch and
rock on this pole the long tail feather stream like pennon

a gentle joyousness a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness invest
the glide whale not the white bull jupiter swim away with
ravish europa cling to -PRON- graceful horn -PRON- lovely leer
eye sideways intent upon the maid with smooth bewitching fleetness
ripple straight for the nuptial bower in crete not jove not that
great majesty supreme do surpass the glorify white whale as -PRON- so
divinely swim

on each soft side coincident with the parted swell that but once
leave -PRON- then flow so wide away on each bright side the whale
shed off enticing no wonder there have be some among the hunter who
namelessly transport and allure by all this serenity have venture
to assail -PRON- but have fatally find that quietude but the vesture of
tornado yet calm enticing calm oh whale thou glidest on to all
who for the first time eye thee no matter how many in that same way
thou may'st have bejuggl and destroy before

and thus through the serene tranquillity of the tropical sea among
wave whose hand clapping be suspend by exceed rapture moby
dick move on still withhold from sight the full terror of -PRON-
submerge trunk entirely hide the wrench hideousness of -PRON- jaw
but soon the fore part of -PRON- slowly rise from the water for an instant
-PRON- whole marbleized body form a high arch like virginia 's natural
bridge and warningly wave -PRON- bannered fluke in the air the
grand god reveal -PRON- sound and go out of sight hoveringly
halt and dip on the wing the white sea fowl longingly linger
over the agitated pool that -PRON- leave

with oar apeak and paddle down the sheet of -PRON- sail adrift the
three boat now stilly float await moby dick 's reappearance

an hour say ahab standing root in -PRON- boat 's stern and -PRON- gaze
beyond the whale 's place towards the dim blue space and wide wooing
vacancy to leeward -PRON- be only an instant for again -PRON- eye seem
whirl round in -PRON- head as -PRON- sweep the watery circle the breeze now
freshen the sea begin to swell

the birds!--the bird cry tashtego

in long indian file as when heron take wing the white bird be
now all fly towards ahab 's boat and when within a few yard begin
flutter over the water there wheel round and round with joyous
expectant cry -PRON- vision be keen than man 's ahab could discover
no sign in the sea but suddenly as -PRON- peer down and down into -PRON-
depth -PRON- profoundly see a white living spot no big than a white
weasel with wonderful celerity uprising and magnifying as -PRON- rise
till -PRON- turn and then there be plainly reveal two long crooked
row of white glisten tooth float up from the undiscoverable
bottom -PRON- be moby dick 's open mouth and scrolled jaw -PRON- vast
shadow bulk still half blend with the blue of the sea the
glitter mouth yawn beneath the boat like an open doored marble
tomb and give one sidelong sweep with -PRON- steering oar ahab whirl
the craft aside from this tremendous apparition then call upon
fedallah to change place with -PRON- go forward to the bow and
seize perth 's harpoon command -PRON- crew to grasp -PRON- oar and
stand by to stern

now by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon -PRON- axis -PRON-
bow by anticipation be make to face the whale 's head while yet
under water but as if perceive this stratagem moby dick with that
malicious intelligence ascribe to -PRON- sidelingly transplant -PRON-
as -PRON- be in an instant shoot -PRON- pleated head lengthwise beneath
the boat

through and through through every plank and each rib -PRON- thrill for
an instant the whale obliquely lie on -PRON- back in the manner of
a bite shark slowly and feelingly take -PRON- bow full within -PRON-
mouth so that the long narrow scroll low jaw curl high up into
the open air and one of the tooth catch in a row lock the bluish
pearl white of the inside of the jaw be within six inch of ahab 's
head and reach high than that in this attitude the white whale
now shake the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat -PRON- mouse with
unastonished eye fedallah gaze and cross -PRON- arm but the
tiger yellow crew be tumble over each other 's head to gain the
uttermost stern

and now while both elastic gunwale be spring in and out as the
whale dally with the doom craft in this devilish way and from -PRON-
body be submerge beneath the boat -PRON- could not be dart at from
the bow for the bow be almost inside of -PRON- as -PRON- be and
while the other boat involuntarily pause as before a quick crisis
impossible to withstand then -PRON- be that monomaniac ahab furious with
this tantalizing vicinity of -PRON- foe which place -PRON- all alive and
helpless in the very jaw -PRON- hat frenzied with all this -PRON- seize
the long bone with -PRON- naked hand and wildly strive to wrench -PRON- from
-PRON- gripe as now -PRON- thus vainly strove the jaw slip from -PRON- the
frail gunwale bent in collapse and snap as both jaw like an
enormous shear slide further aft bit the craft completely in twain
and lock -PRON- fast again in the sea midway between the two
float wreck these float aside the broken end drooping the crew
at the stern wreck cling to the gunwale and strive to hold fast
to the oar to lash -PRON- across

at that preluding moment ere the boat be yet snap ahab the first
to perceive the whale 's intent by the crafty upraising of -PRON- head a
movement that loose -PRON- hold for the time at that moment -PRON- hand
have make one final effort to push the boat out of the bite but only
slip further into the whale 's mouth and tilt over sideways as -PRON-
slip the boat have shake off -PRON- hold on the jaw spill -PRON- out of
-PRON- as -PRON- lean to the push and so -PRON- fall flat faced upon the sea

ripplingly withdraw from -PRON- prey moby dick now lie at a little
distance vertically thrust -PRON- oblong white head up and down in the
billow and at the same time slowly revolve -PRON- whole spindled body
so that when -PRON- vast wrinkled forehead rise some twenty or more foot
out of the water the now rise swell with all -PRON- confluent wave
dazzlingly break against -PRON- vindictively toss -PRON- shiver spray
still high into the air so in a gale the but half baffle channel
billow only recoil from the base of the eddystone triumphantly to
overleap -PRON- summit with -PRON- scud


this motion be peculiar to the sperm whale -PRON- receive -PRON- designation
pitchpol from -PRON- be liken to that preliminary up and down
poise of the whale lance in the exercise call pitchpol previously
describe by this motion the whale must best and most comprehensively
view whatev object may be encircle -PRON-


but soon resume -PRON- horizontal attitude moby dick swim swiftly round
and round the wreck crew sideways churn the water in -PRON- vengeful
wake as if lash -PRON- up to still another and more deadly assault
the sight of the splintered boat seem to madden -PRON- as the blood of
grape and mulberry cast before antiochus 's elephant in the book
of maccabees meanwhile ahab half smother in the foam of the whale 's
insolent tail and too much of a cripple to swim though -PRON- could still
keep afloat even in the heart of such a whirlpool as that helpless
ahab 's head be see like a toss bubble which the least chance shock
may burst from the boat 's fragmentary stern fedallah incuriously and
mildly eye -PRON- the cling crew at the other drift end could not
succor -PRON- more than enough be -PRON- for -PRON- to look to -PRON-
for so revolvingly appalling be the white whale 's aspect and so
planetarily swift the ever contract circle -PRON- make that -PRON- seem
horizontally swoop upon -PRON- and though the other boat unharmed
still hover hard by still -PRON- dare not pull into the eddy to
strike lest that should be the signal for the instant destruction of
the jeopardized castaway ahab and all nor in that case could -PRON-
-PRON- hope to escape with strain eye then -PRON- remain on
the outer edge of the direful zone whose centre have now become the old
man 's head

meantime from the beginning all this have be descry from the ship 's
mast head and square -PRON- yard -PRON- have bear down upon the scene
and be now so nigh that ahab in the water hail her!--"sail on
the but that moment a breaking sea dash on -PRON- from moby dick and
whelm -PRON- for the time but struggle out of -PRON- again and chance
to rise on a towering crest -PRON- shouted,--"sail on the whale!--drive -PRON-
off

the pequod 's prow be point and break up the charm circle -PRON-
effectually part the white whale from -PRON- victim as -PRON- sullenly swim
off the boat fly to the rescue

drag into stubb 's boat with blood shot blind eye the white brine
cake in -PRON- wrinkle the long tension of ahab 's bodily strength do
crack and helplessly -PRON- yield to -PRON- body 's doom for a time lie
all crush in the bottom of stubb 's boat like one trodden under foot
of herd of elephant far inland nameless wail come from -PRON- as
desolate sound from out ravine

but this intensity of -PRON- physical prostration do but so much the more
abbreviate -PRON- in an instant 's compass great heart sometimes condense
to one deep pang the sum total of those shallow pain kindly diffuse
through feeble man 's whole life and so such heart though summary
in each one suffering still if the god decree -PRON- in -PRON-
life time aggregate a whole age of woe wholly make up of instantaneous
intensity for even in -PRON- pointless centre those noble nature
contain the entire circumference of inferior soul

the harpoon say ahab half way rise and draggingly lean on one
bend arm--"is -PRON- safe

aye sir for -PRON- be not dart this be -PRON- say stubb show -PRON-

lay -PRON- before -PRON- any miss man

one two three four five there be five oar sir and here be
five man

that be good help -PRON- man -PRON- wish to stand so so -PRON- see -PRON- there
there go to leeward still what a leap spout!--hand off from -PRON-
the eternal sap run up in ahab 's bone again set the sail out oar
the helm

-PRON- be often the case that when a boat be stove -PRON- crew be pick
up by another boat help to work that second boat and the chase be thus
continue with what be call double bank oar -PRON- be thus now but
the add power of the boat do not equal the add power of the whale
for -PRON- seem to have treble bank -PRON- every fin swim with a
velocity which plainly show that if now under these circumstance
push on the chase would prove an indefinitely prolong if not a
hopeless one nor could any crew endure for so long a period such an
unintermitted intense strain at the oar a thing barely tolerable
only in some one brief vicissitude the ship -PRON- then as -PRON-
sometimes happen offer the most promising intermediate mean of
overtake the chase accordingly the boat now make for -PRON- and be
soon sway up to -PRON- crane the two part of the wrecked boat have
be previously secure by -PRON- and then hoist everything to -PRON-
side and stack -PRON- canvas high up and sideways outstretch -PRON-
with stun sail like the double jointed wing of an albatross the
pequod bear down in the leeward wake of moby dick at the well know
methodic interval the whale 's glitter spout be regularly announce
from the manned mast head and when -PRON- would be report as just go
down ahab would take the time and then pace the deck binnacle watch
in hand so soon as the last second of the allotted hour expire -PRON-
voice be heard.--"whose be the doubloon now d'ye see -PRON- and if the
reply be no sir straightway -PRON- command -PRON- to lift -PRON- to -PRON-
perch in this way the day wear on ahab now aloft and motionless
anon unrestingly pace the plank

as -PRON- be thus walk utter no sound except to hail the man aloft
or to bid -PRON- hoist a sail still high or to spread one to a still
great breadth thus to and fro pacing beneath -PRON- slouch hat at
every turn -PRON- pass -PRON- own wrecked boat which have be drop upon
the quarter deck and lie there reverse break bow to shatter stern
at last -PRON- pause before -PRON- and as in an already over cloud sky fresh
troop of cloud will sometimes sail across so over the old man 's face
there now steal some such added gloom as this

stubb see -PRON- pause and perhaps intend not vainly though to
evince -PRON- own unabated fortitude and thus keep up a valiant place in
-PRON- captain 's mind -PRON- advance and eye the wreck exclaimed--"the
thistle the ass refuse -PRON- prick -PRON- mouth too keenly sir ha ha

what soulless thing be this that laugh before a wreck man man do
-PRON- not know thee brave as fearless fire and as mechanical -PRON- could swear
thou wert a poltroon groan nor laugh should be hear before a wreck

aye sir say starbuck draw near tis a solemn sight an omen
and an ill one

omen omen the dictionary if the god think to speak outright to
man -PRON- will honourably speak outright not shake -PRON- head and
give an old wife darkl hint begone ye two be the opposite pole
of one thing starbuck be stubb reverse and stubb be starbuck and
ye two be all mankind and ahab stand alone among the million of
the peopled earth nor god nor man -PRON- neighbor cold cold -PRON-

though -PRON- spout ten time a second

the day be nearly do only the hem of -PRON- golden robe be rustle
soon -PRON- be almost dark but the look out man still remain unset

ca n't see the spout now sir too dark cry a voice from the air

how head when last see

as before sir straight to leeward

good -PRON- will travel slow now tis night down royal and top gallant
stun sail mr. starbuck -PRON- must not run over -PRON- before morning -PRON- be
make a passage now and may heave to a while helm there keep -PRON-
full before the wind!--aloft come down!--mr stubb send a fresh hand
to the fore mast head and see -PRON- man till morning then advance
towards the doubloon in the main mast--"men this gold be mine for -PRON-
earn -PRON- but -PRON- shall let -PRON- abide here till the white whale be dead
and then whosoever of ye first raise -PRON- upon the day -PRON- shall be
kill this gold be that man 's and if on that day -PRON- shall again raise
-PRON- then ten time -PRON- sum shall be divide among all of ye away
now!--the deck be thine sir

and so say -PRON- place -PRON- half way within the scuttle and
slouch -PRON- hat stand there till dawn except when at interval
rouse -PRON- to see how the night wear on



chapter 134 the chase second day


at day break the three mast head be punctually man afresh

d'ye see -PRON- cry ahab after allow a little space for the light
to spread

see nothing sir

turn up all hand and make sail -PRON- travel fast than -PRON- think
for the top gallant sails!--aye -PRON- should have be keep on -PRON- all
night but no matter--'tis but rest for the rush

here be -PRON- say that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular whale
continue through day into night and through night into day be a thing
by no mean unprecedented in the south sea fishery for such be the
wonderful skill prescience of experience and invincible confidence
acquire by some great natural genius among the nantucket commander
that from the simple observation of a whale when last descry -PRON-
will under certain give circumstance pretty accurately foretell both
the direction in which -PRON- will continue to swim for a time while out of
sight as well as -PRON- probable rate of progression during that period
and in these case somewhat as a pilot when about lose sight of
a coast whose general trending -PRON- well know and which -PRON- desire
shortly to return to again but at some further point like as this
pilot stand by -PRON- compass and take the precise bearing of the
cape at present visible in order the more certainly to hit aright
the remote unseen headland eventually to be visit so do the
fisherman at -PRON- compass with the whale for after be chase and
diligently mark through several hour of daylight then when night
obscure the fish the creature 's future wake through the darkness
be almost as establish to the sagacious mind of the hunter as the
pilot 's coast be to -PRON- so that to this hunter 's wondrous skill the
proverbial evanescence of a thing writ in water a wake be to all
desire purpose well nigh as reliable as the steadfast land and as the
mighty iron leviathan of the modern railway be so familiarly know in
-PRON- every pace that with watch in -PRON- hand man time -PRON- rate as
doctor that of a baby 's pulse and lightly say of -PRON- the up train or
the down train will reach such or such a spot at such or such an hour
even so almost there be occasion when these nantucketers time that
other leviathan of the deep accord to the observed humor of -PRON-
speed and say to -PRON- so many hour hence this whale will have
go two hundred mile will have about reach this or that degree of
latitude or longitude but to render this acuteness at all successful in
the end the wind and the sea must be the whaleman 's ally for of what
present avail to the becalm or windbound mariner be the skill that
assure -PRON- -PRON- be exactly ninety three league and a quarter from -PRON-
port inferable from these statement be many collateral subtile
matter touch the chase of whale

the ship tear on leave such a furrow in the sea as when a
cannon ball missent become a plough share and turn up the level
field

by salt and hemp cry stubb but this swift motion of the deck
creep up one 's leg and tingle at the heart this ship and -PRON- be two
brave fellows!--ha ha some one take -PRON- up and launch -PRON- spine wise
on the sea for by live oak -PRON- spine be a keel ha ha -PRON- go the gait
that leave no dust behind

there -PRON- blow -PRON- blows!--she blows!--right ahead be now the
mast head cry

aye aye cry stubb -PRON- know -PRON- ye can not escape blow on and
split -PRON- spout o whale the mad fiend -PRON- be after ye blow -PRON-
trump blister -PRON- lungs!--ahab will dam off -PRON- blood as a miller
shut -PRON- watergate upon the stream

and stubb do but speak out for well nigh all that crew the frenzy
of the chase have by this time work -PRON- bubblingly up like old wine
work anew whatev pale fear and foreboding some of -PRON- may
have feel before these be not only now keep out of sight through the
grow awe of ahab but -PRON- be break up and on all side rout
as timid prairie hare that scatter before the bound bison the hand
of fate have snatch all -PRON- soul and by the stirring peril of
the previous day the rack of the past night 's suspense the fix
unfearing blind reckless way in which -PRON- wild craft go plunge
towards -PRON- fly mark by all these thing -PRON- heart be bowl
along the wind that make great belly of -PRON- sail and rush the
vessel on by arm invisible as irresistible this seem the symbol of
that unseen agency which so enslave -PRON- to the race

-PRON- be one man not thirty for as the one ship that hold -PRON- all
though -PRON- be put together of all contrast thing oak and maple
and pine wood iron and pitch and hemp yet all these run into each
other in the one concrete hull which shoot on -PRON- way both balance and
direct by the long central keel even so all the individuality of
the crew this man 's valor that man 's fear guilt and guiltiness all
variety be weld into oneness and be all direct to that fatal
goal which ahab -PRON- one lord and keel do point to

the rigging live the mast head like the top of tall palm be
outspreadingly tuft with arm and leg cling to a spar with one
hand some reach forth the other with impatient waving other
shade -PRON- eye from the vivid sunlight sit far out on the rock
yard all the spar in full bearing of mortal ready and ripe for
-PRON- fate ah how -PRON- still strive through that infinite blueness to
seek out the thing that may destroy -PRON-

why sing ye not out for -PRON- if ye see -PRON- cry ahab when after
the lapse of some minute since the first cry no more have be hear
sway -PRON- up man ye have be deceive not moby dick cast one odd jet
that way and then disappear

-PRON- be even so in -PRON- headlong eagerness the man have mistake some
other thing for the whale spout as the event -PRON- soon prove for
hardly have ahab reach -PRON- perch hardly be the rope belay to -PRON-
pin on deck when -PRON- strike the key note to an orchestra that make the
air vibrate as with the combined discharge of rifle the triumphant
halloo of thirty buckskin lung be hear as much nearer to the ship
than the place of the imaginary jet less than a mile ahead moby dick
bodily burst into view for not by any calm and indolent spouting not
by the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in -PRON- head do the white
whale now reveal -PRON- vicinity but by the far more wondrous phenomenon
of breaching rise with -PRON- utmost velocity from the furth depth
the sperm whale thus boom -PRON- entire bulk into the pure element of
air and pile up a mountain of dazzle foam show -PRON- place to the
distance of seven mile and more in those moment the tear enrage
wave -PRON- shake off seem -PRON- mane in some case this breaching be -PRON-
act of defiance

there -PRON- breach there -PRON- breach be the cry as in -PRON-
immeasurable bravado the white whale toss -PRON- salmon like to
heaven so suddenly see in the blue plain of the sea and relieve
against the still bluer margin of the sky the spray that -PRON- raise for
the moment intolerably glitter and glare like a glacier and
stand there gradually fade and fade away from -PRON- first sparkling
intensity to the dim mistiness of an advance shower in a vale

aye breach -PRON- last to the sun moby dick cry ahab thy hour and
thy harpoon be at hand!--down down all of ye but one man at the fore
the boats!--stand by

unmindful of the tedious rope ladder of the shroud the man like
shoot star slide to the deck by the isolated backstay and
halyard while ahab less dartingly but still rapidly be drop from
-PRON- perch

lower away -PRON- cry so soon as -PRON- have reach -PRON- boat a spare one
rig the afternoon previous mr. starbuck the ship be thine keep
away from the boat but keep near -PRON- low all

as if to strike a quick terror into -PRON- by this time be the first
assailant -PRON- moby dick have turn and be now come for the
three crew ahab 's boat be central and cheer -PRON- man -PRON- tell -PRON-
-PRON- would take the whale head and head that be pull straight up to -PRON-
forehead a not uncommon thing for when within a certain limit such
a course exclude the come onset from the whale 's sidelong vision
but ere that close limit be gain and while yet all three boat be
plain as the ship 's three mast to -PRON- eye the white whale churn
-PRON- into furious speed almost in an instant as -PRON- be rush
among the boat with open jaw and a lash tail offer appalling
battle on every side and heedless of the iron dart at -PRON- from every
boat seem only intent on annihilate each separate plank of which
those boat be make but skilfully manoeuvred incessantly wheel
like train charger in the field the boat for a while elude -PRON-
though at time but by a plank 's breadth while all the time ahab 's
unearthly slogan tear every other cry but -PRON- to shreds

but at last in -PRON- untraceable evolution the white whale so cross
and recross and in a thousand way entangle the slack of the three
line now fast to -PRON- that -PRON- foreshorten and of -PRON-
warp the devoted boat towards the plant iron in -PRON- though now
for a moment the whale draw aside a little as if to rally for a more
tremendous charge seize that opportunity ahab first pay out more
line and then be rapidly haul and jerk in upon -PRON- again hop
that way to disencumber -PRON- of some snarl when lo!--a sight more savage
than the embattled tooth of shark

catch and twist corkscrew in the maze of the line loose harpoon
and lance with all -PRON- bristling barb and point come flash
and drip up to the chock in the bow of ahab 's boat only one
thing could be do seize the boat knife -PRON- critically reach
within through and then without the ray of steel drag in
the line beyond pass -PRON- inboard to the bowsman and then twice
sunder the rope near the chock drop the intercept fagot of
steel into the sea and be all fast again that instant the white
whale make a sudden rush among the remain tangle of the other line
by so do irresistibly drag the more involved boat of stubb and
flask towards -PRON- fluke dash -PRON- together like two roll husk on
a surf beat beach and then dive down into the sea disappear in
a boiling maelstrom in which for a space the odorous cedar chip of
the wreck dance round and round like the grate nutmeg in a swiftly
stir bowl of punch

while the two crew be yet circle in the water reach out after
the revolving line tub oar and other float furniture while
aslope little flask bob up and down like an empty vial twitch -PRON-
leg upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of shark and stubb be lustily
sing out for some one to ladle -PRON- up and while the old man 's
line now part admit of -PRON- pull into the creamy pool to
rescue whom -PRON- could in that wild simultaneousness of a thousand
concreted peril ahab 's yet unstricken boat seem draw up towards
heaven by invisible wire as arrow like shoot perpendicularly
from the sea the white whale dash -PRON- broad forehead against -PRON-
bottom and send -PRON- turn over and over into the air till -PRON- fall
again gunwale downward and ahab and -PRON- man struggle out from under
-PRON- like seal from a sea side cave

the first uprising momentum of the whale modify -PRON- direction as
-PRON- strike the surface involuntarily launch -PRON- along -PRON- to a little
distance from the centre of the destruction -PRON- have make and with -PRON-
back to -PRON- -PRON- now lie for a moment slowly feel with -PRON- fluke from
side to side and whenever a stray oar bit of plank the least chip
or crumb of the boat touch -PRON- skin -PRON- tail swiftly draw back and
come sideways smite the sea but soon as if satisfied that -PRON- work
for that time be do -PRON- push -PRON- pleated forehead through the
ocean and trailing after -PRON- the intertangled line continue -PRON-
leeward way at a traveller 's methodic pace

as before the attentive ship have descry the whole fight again
come bear down to the rescue and drop a boat pick up the
float mariner tub oar and whatev else could be catch at and
safely land -PRON- on -PRON- deck some sprain shoulder wrist and
ankle livid contusion wrench harpoon and lance inextricable
intricacy of rope shatter oar and plank all these be there
but no fatal or even serious ill seem to have befall any one as
with fedallah the day before so ahab be now find grimly cling to
-PRON- boat 's break half which afford a comparatively easy float nor
do -PRON- so exhaust -PRON- as the previous day 's mishap

but when -PRON- be help to the deck all eye be fasten upon -PRON- as
instead of stand by -PRON- -PRON- still half hang upon the shoulder of
starbuck who have thus far be the foremost to assist -PRON- -PRON- ivory
leg have be snap off leave but one short sharp splinter

aye aye starbuck tis sweet to lean sometimes be the lean who -PRON-
will and would old ahab have lean oftener than -PRON- have

the ferrule have not stand sir say the carpenter now come up -PRON-
put good work into that leg

but no bone break sir -PRON- hope say stubb with true concern

aye and all splinter to piece stubb!--d'ye see -PRON- but even with
a broken bone old ahab be untouched and -PRON- account no live bone of
-PRON- one jot more -PRON- than this dead one that be lose nor white whale
nor man nor fiend can so much as graze old ahab in -PRON- own proper and
inaccessible being can any lead touch yonder floor any mast scrape
yonder roof aloft there which way

dead to leeward sir

up helm then pile on the sail again ship keeper down the rest of
the spare boat and rig -PRON- mr starbuck away and muster the boat 's
crew

let -PRON- first help thee towards the bulwark sir

oh oh oh how this splinter gore -PRON- now accursed fate that the
unconquerable captain in the soul should have such a craven mate

sir

-PRON- body man not thee give -PRON- something for a cane there that
shiver lance will do muster the man surely -PRON- have not see -PRON- yet
by heaven -PRON- can not be!--miss quick call -PRON- all

the old man 's hint thought be true upon muster the company the
parsee be not there

the parsee cry stubb--"he must have be catch in--

the black vomit wrench thee!--run all of ye above alow cabin
forecastle find -PRON- not go not go

but quickly -PRON- return to -PRON- with the tiding that the parsee be
nowhere to be find

aye sir say stubb--"caught among the tangle of -PRON- line -PRON-
think -PRON- see -PRON- drag under

my line my line go go what mean that little word what
death knell ring in -PRON- that old ahab shake as if -PRON- be the belfry
the harpoon too!--toss over the litter there d'ye see -PRON- the forge
iron man the white whale's no no no blister fool this hand do
dart it!--'tis in the fish!--aloft there keep -PRON- nailed quick!--all
hand to the rigging of the boat collect the oar harpooneer
the iron the irons!--hoist the royal high a pull on all the
sheets!--helm there steady steady for -PRON- life -PRON- will ten time girdle
the unmeasured globe yea and dive straight through -PRON- but -PRON- will slay
-PRON- yet

great god but for one single instant show thyself cry starbuck
never never wilt thou capture -PRON- old man in jesus name no more of
this that be bad than devil 's madness two day chase twice stove
to splinter thy very leg once more snatch from under thee thy evil
shadow go all good angel mob thee with warnings:--

what more wouldst thou have shall -PRON- keep chase this murderous fish
till -PRON- swamp the last man shall -PRON- be drag by -PRON- to the bottom
of the sea shall -PRON- be tow by -PRON- to the infernal world oh
oh impiety and blasphemy to hunt -PRON- more

starbuck of late -PRON- have feel strangely move to thee ever since that
hour -PRON- both see thou know'st what in one another 's eye but in this
matter of the whale be the front of thy face to -PRON- as the palm of this
hand a lipless unfeatured blank ahab be for ever ahab man this
whole act 's immutably decree twas rehearse by thee and -PRON- a billion
year before this ocean roll fool -PRON- be the fates lieutenant -PRON- act
under order look thou underling that thou obeyest mine stand round
-PRON- man ye see an old man cut down to the stump lean on a shivered
lance prop up on a lonely foot tis ahab -PRON- body 's part but
ahab 's soul be a centipede that move upon a hundred leg -PRON- feel
strain half strand as rope that tow dismasted frigate in a gale
and -PRON- may look so but ere -PRON- break ye'll hear -PRON- crack and till ye hear
that know that ahab 's hawser tow -PRON- purpose yet believe ye man in
the thing call omen then laugh aloud and cry encore for ere -PRON-
drown drown thing will twice rise to the surface then rise again
to sink for evermore so with moby dick two day -PRON- be float tomorrow
will be the third aye man -PRON- will rise once more but only to spout
-PRON- last d'ye feel brave man brave

as fearless fire cry stubb

and as mechanical mutter ahab then as the man go forward -PRON-
mutter on the thing call omen and yesterday -PRON- talk the same
to starbuck there concern -PRON- broken boat oh how valiantly -PRON- seek
to drive out of other heart what be clinch so fast in mine!--the
parsee the parsee!--gone go and -PRON- be to go before but still be
to be see again ere -PRON- could perish how be that there be a riddle now
may baffle all the lawyer back by the ghost of the whole line
of judge like a hawk 's beak -PRON- peck -PRON- brain i'll i'll solve -PRON-
though

when dusk descend the whale be still in sight to leeward

so once more the sail be shorten and everything pass nearly as
on the previous night only the sound of hammer and the hum of the
grindstone be hear till nearly daylight as the man toil by lantern
in the complete and careful rigging of the spare boat and sharpen
-PRON- fresh weapon for the morrow meantime of the break keel of
ahab 's wreck craft the carpenter make -PRON- another leg while still as
on the night before slouch ahab stand fix within -PRON- scuttle -PRON-
hide heliotrope glance anticipatingly go backward on -PRON- dial sit due
eastward for the early sun



chapter 135 the chase third day


the morning of the third day dawn fair and fresh and once more the
solitary night man at the fore mast head be relieve by crowd of the
daylight look out who dot every mast and almost every spar

d'ye see -PRON- cry ahab but the whale be not yet in sight

in -PRON- infallible wake though but follow that wake that be all helm
there steady as thou goest and hast be go what a lovely day
again be -PRON- a new make world and make for a summer house to the
angel and this morning the first of -PRON- throw open to -PRON- a
fair day could not dawn upon that world here be food for thought have
ahab time to think but ahab never think -PRON- only feel feel feel
that be tingling enough for mortal man to think 's audacity god only have
that right and privilege think be or ought to be a coolness and a
calmness and -PRON- poor heart throb and -PRON- poor brain beat too much
for that and yet -PRON- have sometimes think -PRON- brain be very calm frozen
calm this old skull crack so like a glass in which the content
turn to ice and shiver -PRON- and still this hair be grow now this
moment grow and heat must breed -PRON- but no -PRON- be like that sort
of common grass that will grow anywhere between the earthy cleft of
greenland ice or in vesuvius lava how the wild wind blow -PRON- -PRON- whip
-PRON- about -PRON- as the torn shred of split sail lash the toss ship -PRON-
cl to a vile wind that have no doubt blow ere this through prison
corridor and cell and ward of hospital and ventilate -PRON- and
now come blow hither as innocent as fleece out upon it!--it 's
taint be -PRON- the wind -PRON- would blow no more on such a wicked miserable
world -PRON- would crawl somewhere to a cave and slink there and yet tis a
noble and heroic thing the wind who ever conquer -PRON- in every fight
-PRON- have the last and bitter blow run tilt at -PRON- and -PRON- but run
through -PRON- ha a coward wind that strike stark naked man but will not
stand to receive a single blow even ahab be a braver thing a noble
thing than that would now the wind but have a body but all the thing
that most exasperate and outrage mortal man all these thing be
bodiless but only bodiless as object not as agent there be a most
special a most cunning oh a most malicious difference and yet -PRON-
say again and swear -PRON- now that there be something all glorious and
gracious in the wind these warm trade winds at least that in the
clear heaven blow straight on in strong and steadfast vigorous
mildness and veer not from -PRON- mark however the baser current of
the sea may turn and tack and mighty mississippies of the land swift
and swerve about uncertain where to go at last and by the eternal
pole these same trade that so directly blow -PRON- good ship on these
trades or something like -PRON- something so unchangeable and full as
strong blow -PRON- keeled soul along to -PRON- aloft there what d'ye see

nothing sir

nothing and noon at hand the doubloon go a begging see the sun
aye aye -PRON- must be so -PRON- have oversail -PRON- how get the start aye
-PRON- be chase me now not -PRON- him that be bad -PRON- may have know -PRON- too
fool the line the harpoon -PRON- be towing aye aye -PRON- have run -PRON- by
last night about about come down all of ye but the regular look
out man the brace

steering as -PRON- have do the wind have be somewhat on the pequod 's
quarter so that now be point in the reverse direction the braced
ship sail hard upon the breeze as -PRON- rechurn the cream in -PRON- own
white wake

against the wind -PRON- now steer for the open jaw murmur starbuck to
-PRON- as -PRON- coil the new haul main brace upon the rail god keep
-PRON- but already -PRON- bone feel damp within -PRON- and from the inside wet -PRON-
flesh -PRON- misdoubt -PRON- that -PRON- disobey -PRON- god in obey -PRON-

stand by to sway -PRON- up cry ahab advance to the hempen basket
-PRON- should meet -PRON- soon

aye aye sir and straightway starbuck do ahab 's bidding and once
more ahab swing on high

a whole hour now pass gold beat out to age time -PRON- now hold
long breath with keen suspense but at last some three point off the
weather bow ahab descry the spout again and instantly from the three
mast head three shriek go up as if the tongue of fire have voice
-PRON-

forehead to forehead -PRON- meet thee this third time moby dick on deck
there!--brace sharp up crowd -PRON- into the wind 's eye -PRON- be too
far off to lower yet mr. starbuck the sail shake stand over that
helmsman with a top maul so so -PRON- travel fast and -PRON- must down but
let -PRON- have one more good round look aloft here at the sea there be
time for that an old old sight and yet somehow so young aye and
not change a wink since -PRON- first see -PRON- a boy from the sand hill of
nantucket the same!--the same!--the same to noah as to -PRON- there be
a soft shower to leeward such lovely leewarding -PRON- must lead
somewhere to something else than common land more palmy than the
palm leeward the white whale go that way look to windward
then the good if the bitterer quarter but good bye good bye old
mast head what be this green aye tiny moss in these warp crack
no such green weather stain on ahab 's head there be the difference now
between man 's old age and matter 's but aye old mast -PRON- both grow old
together sound in -PRON- hull though be -PRON- not -PRON- ship aye minus
a leg that be all by heaven this dead wood have the good of -PRON- live
flesh every way -PRON- can not compare with -PRON- and -PRON- have know some ship make
of dead tree outlast the life of man make of the most vital stuff of
vital father what be that -PRON- say -PRON- should still go before -PRON- -PRON-
pilot and yet to be see again but where will -PRON- have eye at the
bottom of the sea suppose -PRON- descend those endless stair and all
night -PRON- have be sail from -PRON- wherever -PRON- do sink to aye aye
like many more thou told'st direful truth as touch thyself o parsee
but ahab there thy shot fall short good bye mast head keep a good
eye upon the whale the while -PRON- be go -PRON- will talk to morrow nay
to night when the white whale lie down there tie by head and tail

-PRON- give the word and still gaze round -PRON- be steadily lower
through the cleave blue air to the deck

in due time the boat be lower but as stand in -PRON- shallop 's
stern ahab just hover upon the point of the descent -PRON- wave to the
mate who hold one of the tackle rope on deck and bid -PRON- pause

starbuck

sir

for the third time -PRON- soul 's ship start upon this voyage starbuck

aye sir thou wilt have -PRON- so

some ship sail from -PRON- port and ever afterwards be miss
starbuck

truth sir sad truth

some man die at ebb tide some at low water some at the full of
the flood and -PRON- feel now like a billow that be all one crest comb
starbuck -PRON- be old shake hand with -PRON- man

-PRON- hand meet -PRON- eye fasten starbuck 's tear the glue

oh -PRON- captain -PRON- captain!--noble heart go not go not!--see -PRON- be a
brave man that weep how great the agony of the persuasion then

low away!"--cried ahab toss the mate 's arm from -PRON- stand by
the crew

in an instant the boat be pull round close under the stern

the shark the shark cry a voice from the low cabin window there
o master -PRON- master come back

but ahab hear nothing for -PRON- own voice be high lift then and the
boat leap on

yet the voice spake true for scarce have -PRON- push from the ship when
number of shark seemingly rise from out the dark water beneath
the hull maliciously snap at the blade of the oar every time -PRON-
dip in the water and in this way accompany the boat with -PRON-
bite -PRON- be a thing not uncommonly happen to the whale boat in
those swarm sea the shark at time apparently follow -PRON- in
the same prescient way that vultur hover over the banner of march
regiment in the east but these be the first shark that have be
observe by the pequod since the white whale have be first descry
and whether -PRON- be that ahab 's crew be all such tiger yellow
barbarian and therefore -PRON- flesh more musky to the sens of the
shark a matter sometimes well known to affect -PRON- however -PRON- be
-PRON- seem to follow that one boat without molest the other

heart of work steel murmur starbuck gaze over the side and
follow with -PRON- eye the recede boat--"canst thou yet r boldly
to that sight lower thy keel among raven shark and follow by
-PRON- open mouthed to the chase and this the critical third day for
when three day flow together in one continuous intense pursuit be sure
the first be the morning the second the noon and the third the evening
and the end of that thing be that end what -PRON- may oh -PRON- god what
be this that shoot through -PRON- and leave -PRON- so deadly calm yet
expectant fix at the top of a shudder future thing swim before -PRON-
as in empty outline and skeleton all the past be somehow grow dim
mary girl thou fad in pale glory behind -PRON- boy -PRON- seem to
see but thy eye grow wondrous blue strange problem of life seem
clearing but cloud sweep between be -PRON- journey 's end come -PRON- leg
feel faint like -PRON- who have foot -PRON- all day feel thy heart beat
-PRON- yet stir thyself starbuck!--stave -PRON- off move move
speak aloud!--mast head there see ye -PRON- boy 's hand on the
hill crazed aloft there!--keep thy keen eye upon the boats:--

mark well the whale!--ho again!--drive off that hawk see -PRON- peck -PRON-
tear the vane point to the red flag flying at the main truck--"ha
-PRON- soar away with it!--where be the old man now see'st thou that sight
oh ahab!--shudder shudder

the boat have not go very far when by a signal from the mast head a
downward pointed arm ahab know that the whale have sound but
intend to be near -PRON- at the next rise -PRON- hold on -PRON- way a little
sideways from the vessel the becharmed crew maintain the profoundest
silence as the head beat wave hammer and hammer against the
oppose bow

drive drive in -PRON- nail oh ye wave to -PRON- uttermost head
drive -PRON- in ye but strike a thing without a lid and no coffin and no
hearse can be -PRON- and hemp only can kill -PRON- ha ha

suddenly the water around -PRON- slowly swell in broad circle then
quickly upheave as if sideways slide from a submerged berg of
ice swiftly rise to the surface a low rumbling sound be hear a
subterraneous hum and then all hold -PRON- breath as bedraggle with
trail rope and harpoon and lance a vast form shot lengthwise
but obliquely from the sea shroud in a thin drooping veil of mist -PRON-
hover for a moment in the rainbowed air and then fall swamp back
into the deep crushed thirty foot upwards the water flash for
an instant like heap of fountain then brokenly sink in a shower of
flake leave the circling surface cream like new milk round the
marble trunk of the whale

give way cry ahab to the oarsman and the boat dart forward to
the attack but madden by yesterday 's fresh iron that corrode in
-PRON- moby dick seem combinedly possess by all the angel that fall
from heaven the wide tier of weld tendon overspread -PRON- broad
white forehead beneath the transparent skin look knitted together
as head on -PRON- come churn -PRON- tail among the boat and once more
flail -PRON- apart spill out the iron and lance from the two
mate boat and dash in one side of the upper part of -PRON- bow
but leave ahab 's almost without a scar

while daggoo and queequeg be stop the strained plank and as the
whale swim out from -PRON- turn and show one entire flank as -PRON-
shoot by -PRON- again at that moment a quick cry go up lash round
and round to the fish 's back pinion in the turn upon turn in which
during the past night the whale have reel the involution of the line
around -PRON- the half tear body of the parsee be see -PRON- sable raiment
frayed to shreds -PRON- distended eye turn full upon old ahab

the harpoon drop from -PRON- hand

befool befooled!"--draw in a long lean breath--"aye parsee -PRON-
see thee again aye and thou go before and this this then be the
hearse that thou didst promise but -PRON- hold thee to the last letter of
thy word where be the second hearse away mate to the ship those
boat be useless now repair -PRON- if ye can in time and return to
-PRON- if not ahab be enough to die down man the first thing that but
offer to jump from this boat -PRON- stand in that thing -PRON- harpoon ye be
not other man but -PRON- arm and -PRON- leg and so obey -PRON- where be the
whale go down again

but -PRON- look too nigh the boat for as if bend upon escape with the
corpse -PRON- bear and as if the particular place of the last encounter have
be but a stage in -PRON- leeward voyage moby dick be now again steadily
swim forward and have almost pass the ship which thus far have
be sail in the contrary direction to -PRON- though for the present
-PRON- headway have be stop -PRON- seem swim with -PRON- utmost
velocity and now only intent upon pursue -PRON- own straight path in the
sea

oh ahab cry starbuck not too late be -PRON- even now the third
day to desist see moby dick seek thee not -PRON- be thou thou that
madly seekest -PRON-

set sail to the rise wind the lonely boat be swiftly impel to
leeward by both oar and canvas and at last when ahab be slide
by the vessel so near as plainly to distinguish starbuck 's face as -PRON-
lean over the rail -PRON- hail -PRON- to turn the vessel about and follow
-PRON- not too swiftly at a judicious interval glance upwards -PRON-
see tashtego queequeg and daggoo eagerly mount to the three
mast head while the oarsman be rock in the two stave boat
which have but just be hoist to the side and be busily at work in
repair -PRON- one after the other through the port hole as -PRON- speed
-PRON- also catch fly glimpse of stubb and flask busy -PRON-
on deck among bundle of new iron and lance as -PRON- see all this as -PRON-
hear the hammer in the broken boat far other hammer seem drive
a nail into -PRON- heart but -PRON- rally and now mark that the vane or
flag be go from the main mast head -PRON- shout to tashtego who have
just gain that perch to descend again for another flag and a hammer
and nail and so nail -PRON- to the mast

whether fag by the three day running chase and the resistance
to -PRON- swimming in the knot hamper -PRON- bear or whether -PRON- be some
latent deceitfulness and malice in -PRON- whichev be true the white
whale 's way now begin to abate as -PRON- seem from the boat so rapidly
near -PRON- once more though indeed the whale 's last start have not be
so long a one as before and still as ahab glide over the wave the
unpity shark accompany -PRON- and so pertinaciously stuck to the
boat and so continually bit at the ply oar that the blade become
jagged and crunch and leave small splinter in the sea at almost
every dip

heed -PRON- not those tooth but give new rowlock to -PRON- oar pull on
tis the good rest the shark 's jaw than the yield water

but at every bite sir the thin blade grow small and small

-PRON- will last long enough pull on!--but who can tell -PRON-
muttered--"wheth these shark swim to feast on the whale or on
ahab but pull on aye all alive now -PRON- near -PRON- the helm take the
helm let -PRON- pass and so say two of the oarsman help -PRON- forward
to the bow of the still fly boat

at length as the craft be cast to one side and run range along
with the white whale 's flank -PRON- seem strangely oblivious of -PRON-
advance as the whale sometimes will and ahab be fairly within the
smoky mountain mist which throw off from the whale 's spout curl
round -PRON- great monadnock hump -PRON- be even thus close to -PRON- when
with body arch back and both arm lengthwise high lift to the
poise -PRON- dart -PRON- fierce iron and -PRON- far fierce curse into the
hat whale as both steel and curse sink to the socket as if suck
into a morass moby dick sideways writhe spasmodically roll -PRON- nigh
flank against the bow and without stave a hole in -PRON- so suddenly
cant the boat over that have -PRON- not be for the elevated part of the
gunwale to which -PRON- then cling ahab would once more have be toss
into the sea as -PRON- be three of the oarsman who foreknow not the
precise instant of the dart and be therefore unprepared for -PRON-
effect these be flung out but so fell that in an instant two of
-PRON- clutch the gunwale again and rise to -PRON- level on a comb
wave hurl -PRON- bodily inboard again the third man helplessly
drop astern but still afloat and swimming

almost simultaneously with a mighty volition of ungraduated
instantaneous swiftness the white whale dart through the weltering
sea but when ahab cry out to the steersman to take new turn with
the line and hold -PRON- so and command the crew to turn round on -PRON-
seat and tow the boat up to the mark the moment the treacherous line
feel that double strain and tug -PRON- snap in the empty air

what break in -PRON- some sinew cracks!--'tis whole again oar oar
burst in upon -PRON-

hear the tremendous rush of the sea crash boat the whale wheel
round to present -PRON- blank forehead at bay but in that evolution
catch sight of the near black hull of the ship seemingly see
in -PRON- the source of all -PRON- persecution bethink -PRON- -PRON- may be a
large and noble foe of a sudden -PRON- bear down upon -PRON- advance
prow smite -PRON- jaws amid fiery shower of foam

ahab stagger -PRON- hand smite -PRON- forehead -PRON- grow blind hand
stretch out before -PRON- that -PRON- may yet grope -PRON- way is't night

the whale the ship cry the cringe oarsman

oar oar slope downward to thy depth o sea that ere -PRON- be for
ever too late ahab may slide this last last time upon -PRON- mark -PRON- see
the ship the ship dash on -PRON- man will ye not save -PRON- ship

but as the oarsman violently force -PRON- boat through the
sledge hammer sea the before whale smitten bow end of two plank
burst through and in an instant almost the temporarily disabled boat
lie nearly level with the wave -PRON- half wad splash crew try
hard to stop the gap and bale out the pour water

meantime for that one behold instant tashtego 's mast head hammer
remain suspend in -PRON- hand and the red flag half wrap -PRON- as
with a plaid then stream -PRON- straight out from -PRON- as -PRON- own
forward flow heart while starbuck and stubb stand upon the
bowsprit beneath catch sight of the down come monster just as soon
as -PRON-

the whale the whale up helm up helm oh all ye sweet power of air
now hug -PRON- close let not starbuck die if die -PRON- must in a woman 's
fainting fit up helm -PRON- say ye fool the jaw the jaw be this the
end of all -PRON- bursting prayer all -PRON- life long fidelity oh ahab
ahab lo thy work steady helmsman steady nay nay up helm again
-PRON- turn to meet -PRON- oh -PRON- unappeasable brow drive on towards one
whose duty tell -PRON- -PRON- can not depart -PRON- god stand by -PRON- now

stand not by -PRON- but stand under -PRON- whoever -PRON- be that will now help
stubb for stubb too stick here -PRON- grin at thee thou grin whale
who ever help stubb or keep stubb awake but stubb 's own unwinking
eye and now poor stubb go to bed upon a mattrass that be all too
soft would -PRON- be stuff with brushwood -PRON- grin at thee thou
grin whale look ye sun moon and star -PRON- call ye assassin of
as good a fellow as ever spout up -PRON- ghost for all that -PRON- would yet
ring glass with ye would ye but hand the cup oh oh oh oh thou
grin whale but there will be plenty of gulp soon why fly ye
not o ahab for -PRON- off shoe and jacket to -PRON- let stubb die in
-PRON- drawer a most mouldy and over salt death though cherry
cherry cherry oh flask for one red cherry ere -PRON- die

cherry -PRON- only wish that -PRON- be where -PRON- grow oh stubb -PRON- hope
-PRON- poor mother 's draw -PRON- part pay ere this if not few copper will
now come to -PRON- for the voyage be up

from the ship 's bow nearly all the seaman now hang inactive hammer
bit of plank lance and harpoon mechanically retain in -PRON-
hand just as -PRON- have dart from -PRON- various employment all -PRON-
enchanted eye intent upon the whale which from side to side strangely
vibrate -PRON- predestinating head send a broad band of overspread
semicircular foam before -PRON- as -PRON- rush retribution swift vengeance
eternal malice be in -PRON- whole aspect and spite of all that mortal
man could do the solid white buttress of -PRON- forehead smote the ship 's
starboard bow till man and timber reel some fall flat upon -PRON-
face like dislodged truck the head of the harpooneer aloft shake
on -PRON- bull like neck through the breach -PRON- hear the water
pour as mountain torrent down a flume

the ship the hearse!--the second hearse cry ahab from the boat
-PRON- wood could only be american

diving beneath the settle ship the whale run quivering along -PRON-
keel but turn under water swiftly shoot to the surface again far
off the other bow but within a few yard of ahab 's boat where for a
time -PRON- lie quiescent

-PRON- turn -PRON- body from the sun what ho tashtego let -PRON- hear thy hammer
oh ye three unsurrendered spire of mine thou uncrack keel and only
god bully hull thou firm deck and haughty helm and pole point
prow death glorious ship must ye then perish and without -PRON- be -PRON-
cut off from the last fond pride of mean shipwreck captain oh
lonely death on lonely life oh now -PRON- feel -PRON- topmost greatness lie in
-PRON- topmost grief ho ho from all -PRON- furthest bound pour ye now in
ye bold billow of -PRON- whole foregone life and top this one pile comber
of -PRON- death towards thee -PRON- roll thou all destroy but unconquer
whale to the last -PRON- grapple with thee from hell 's heart -PRON- stab at
thee for hate 's sake -PRON- spit -PRON- last breath at thee sink all coffin
and all hearse to one common pool and since neither can be -PRON- let
-PRON- then tow to piece while still chase thee though tie to thee
thou damned whale thus -PRON- give up the spear

the harpoon be dart the stricken whale fly forward with ignite
velocity the line run through the groove run foul ahab stoop to
clear -PRON- -PRON- do clear -PRON- but the fly turn catch -PRON- round the
neck and voicelessly as turkish mute bowstr -PRON- victim -PRON- be
shoot out of the boat ere the crew know -PRON- be go next instant the
heavy eye splice in the rope 's final end fly out of the stark empty
tub knock down an oarsman and smite the sea disappear in -PRON-
depth

for an instant the tranced boat 's crew stand still then turn the
ship great god where be the ship soon -PRON- through dim bewilder
medium see -PRON- sidelong fade phantom as in the gaseous fata morgana
only the uppermost mast out of water while fix by infatuation or
fidelity or fate to -PRON- once lofty perch the pagan harpooneer
still maintain -PRON- sink lookout on the sea and now concentric
circle seize the lone boat -PRON- and all -PRON- crew and each float
oar and every lance pole and spinning animate and inanimate all
round and round in one vortex carry the small chip of the pequod
out of sight

but as the last whelming intermixingly pour -PRON- over the
sink head of the indian at the mainmast leave a few inch of the
erect spar yet visible together with long stream yard of the flag
which calmly undulate with ironical coinciding over the destroy
billow -PRON- almost touch at that instant a red arm and a hammer
hover backwardly uplift in the open air in the act of nail
the flag faster and yet faster to the subsiding spar a sky hawk that
tauntingly have follow the main truck downward from -PRON- natural home
among the star peck at the flag and incommode tashtego there
this bird now chance to intercept -PRON- broad fluttering wing between the
hammer and the wood and simultaneously feel that etherial thrill
the submerge savage beneath in -PRON- death gasp keep -PRON- hammer frozen
there and so the bird of heaven with archangelic shriek and -PRON-
imperial beak thrust upwards and -PRON- whole captive form fold in the
flag of ahab go down with -PRON- ship which like satan would not sink
to hell till -PRON- have drag a living part of heaven along with -PRON- and
helmet -PRON- with -PRON-

now small fowl fly scream over the yet yawn gulf a sullen white
surf beat against -PRON- steep side then all collapse and the great
shroud of the sea roll on as -PRON- roll five thousand year ago




epilogue

and -PRON- only be escaped alone to tell thee job

the drama be do why then here do any one step forth because one
do survive the wreck

-PRON- so chance that after the parsee 's disappearance -PRON- be -PRON- whom the
fate ordain to take the place of ahab 's bowsman when that bowsman
assume the vacant post the same who when on the last day the three
man be toss from out of the rock boat be drop astern so
float on the margin of the ensue scene and in full sight of -PRON-
when the halfspent suction of the sink ship reach -PRON- -PRON- be then
but slowly draw towards the closing vortex when -PRON- reach -PRON- -PRON- have
subside to a creamy pool round and round then and ever contract
towards the button like black bubble at the axis of that slowly wheel
circle like another ixion -PRON- do revolve till gain that vital
centre the black bubble upward burst and now liberate by reason of
-PRON- cunning spring and owe to -PRON- great buoyancy rise with great
force the coffin life buoy shot lengthwise from the sea fall over and
float by -PRON- side buoy up by that coffin for almost one whole day
and night -PRON- float on a soft and dirgelike main the unharming shark
-PRON- glide by as if with padlock on -PRON- mouth the savage sea hawk
sail with sheathe beak on the second day a sail draw near nearer
and pick -PRON- up at last -PRON- be the devious cruise rachel that in
-PRON- retracing search after -PRON- missing child only find another
orphan

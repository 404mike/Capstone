# Project 1: Literary Analysis with NLP

Goal: Gain some insight about literary texts using NLP.  I haven't settled yet on the exact analysis I want
to do, but some ideas I've had floating around are:
* Predicting authorship of books, based on other works by that other (training set = one set of his/her
  books, test set = another set)
* Grouping books by thematic elements via latent feature analysis (SVD/PCA/as appropriate)
* Character sentiment analysis: choose some subset of famous literary characters and analyze their dialogue
  to do sentiment analysis... challenge here would be to isolate a given character's dialogue, so not sure
  this is actually feasible.
There's really so much possibility here - the issue is going to be narrowing it down!

Data Source: Project Gutenberg 
( http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:Information_About_Robot_Access_to_our_Pages ) has full text of 
54,000 (!!) public domain books available for download!  This would be a really great dataset to use to play
with NLP.  I am pretty confident I'll be able to obtain and use this dataset, but it's a little involved to 
get started, and so I haven't validated this assumption yet.  So I guess this is my 'I think I can get the 
data' proposal.

Presentation Format: Slides

Next Step: Confirm that the data accessibility will work as I'm anticipating (ie download the data).



# Project 2: Alzheimers Prediction with MRI data  <--- Proposal rejected; project scope not big enough, unless
**I can find some goal beyond the basic kaggle problem**

Goal: Using a dataset of MRI scans of both healthy individuals and patients affected by Alzheimer's, train a 
model to predict Alzheimer's based on a MRI scan.

Data Source: This is a kaggle competition ( https://www.kaggle.com/jboysen/mri-and-alzheimers ).  That part
I'm not super excited about, but this project is both easily relatable and has readily apparent importance. 
It also holds some special significance to me; I've got an Alzheimer's on both sides of my family.  This is 
my 'I can definitely get the data' proposal, since the data is right there and available for download.  This 
is the backup to my backup.

Presentation Format: Slides

Next Step: None that I can think of right now.



# Project 3: TBD collaboration with Terminal Labs

I'm in discussions with the CIO of a local company (Terminal Labs) about collaborating on a project with 
them. I'm about 70% sure at this point that it is going to go forward.  My contact is meeting with the team 
early this week to flesh out some ideas of what would be most useful to them, and I plan to meet with him  
again later this week to finalize an idea.  We've agreed on a deadline of Friday 9/1 for the topic - this 
would allow me to have a solid proposal ready for galvanize instructor review by Monday 9/4.

This is my Plan A right now, but I feel really good about my Plan B (the Literary Analysis with NLP project) if
this does fall apart.  

Next step: Follow up with email tomorrow morning and phone call tomorrow afternoon.  Go/no go decision neeeded
when?

I've also got some more ideas here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lenTRKramtTyTRHPKd__rCq2IVCf4PyT6o2RrXosKis/edit?usp=sharing

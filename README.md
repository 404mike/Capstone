# Literary Analysis with NLP: LDA Topic Modeling

## Project Description

Using a corpus of ~28,000 texts harvested from Project Gutenberg, a large online repository of ebooks, I've developed a topic model of these texts using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). The topic model allows us to understand a given text in terms of an 'constituent topics', for example: a book could contain a mixture of topics such as 'rome', 'classical music', and 'chemistry'.  It can also tell us topics related to a given word, or books related to given topic.  There's so much you can learn about a corpus (collection of documents) by fitting and exploring a topic model!


### Reproducibility with Project Rambo (tool by Terminal Labs)

For this project, I collaborated with Terminal Labs to use their open-source ![project Rambo](https://github.com/terminal-labs/rambo).  This tool allows users to automate Vagrant provisioning and configuration of virtual machines for use on distributed computing resources (including AWS, Digitial Ocean, and VirtualBox).  Not only was it a valuable aid during the development cycle, but it allows the work to be reliably reproduced by anyone, anywhere!

# Networks from Topic Models: Literary Analysis using NLP

## Project Description

Using a corpus harvested from Project Gutenberg, a massive online repository of ebooks, this project will develop a topic model of these texts using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).  

Through the use of this and other NLP techniques, I will gain an understanding of the underlying topics that are shared amongst the collection of books, and use this information to infer a network showing their relationships to one another.

### Please excuse the mess - project still under construction!

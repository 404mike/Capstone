# Networks from Topic Models: Literary Analysis using NLP

## Project Description

Using a corpus harvested from Project Gutenberg, a massive online repository of ebooks, this project will develop a topic model of these texts using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).  

Through the use of this and other NLP techniques, I will gain an understanding of the underlying topics that are shared amongst the collection of books, and use this information to infer a network showing their relationships to one another.

## Collaboration with Terminal Labs: Project Rambo utilization

For this project, I am collaborating with Terminal Labs to use their open-source ![project Rambo](https://github.com/terminal-labs/rambo).  This tool allows me to automate Vagrant provisioning and configuration of virtual machines for use on distributed computing resources.  Not only is it a valuable aid during the development cycle, but it will make my data science work reliably reproducible for years to come!

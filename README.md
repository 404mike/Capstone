# Literary Analysis with NLP: LDA Topic Modeling

## Project Description

Using a corpus of 5000 books harvested from Project Gutenberg, a large online repository of ebooks, I've developed a topic model of these texts using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). The topic model allows us to understand a given text almost in terms of an 'ingredients list' - for example, a book could be 40% mystery, 17% romance, 9% thriller, and so on. 


### Reproducibility with Project Rambo (tool by Terminal Labs)

For this project, I collaborated with Terminal Labs to use their open-source ![project Rambo](https://github.com/terminal-labs/rambo).  This tool allows users to automate Vagrant provisioning and configuration of virtual machines for use on distributed computing resources.  Not only was it a valuable aid during the development cycle, but it allows the work to be reliably reproduced by anyone, anywhere!
